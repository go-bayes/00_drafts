\begin{abstract}
Max Weber described the loss of religion as ``the disenchantment of the
world.'' However, quantifying the mangitude of disenchantment from the
loss of religion has yet to be attempted. Indeed, whether religious
disaffiliation causally affects people at all is unclear and cannot be
determined from cross-sectional data. Here, we use a potential outcomes
framework from causal inference to contrast the expected effects of
religious disaffilation accross a wide range of multi-dimensional
wellbeing, one year after religious change.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Max Weber famously described the loss of religion as ``the
disenchantment of the world'' (Wilson, J., and Sibley 2014). However, it
is unclear whether, and in which ways, disaffiliation causes
disenchantment.

Although cross-sectional data may be suggestive of relationships,
cross-sectional data are essentially useless for inferring causality.
For example, it is possible that people who score low in meaning of life
tend to shed their religious affiliation at a higher rate than people
who score high in meaning of life. The associations in cross-sectional
data cannot rule out this possibility. It is plausible that individuals
with low life meaning are more likely to distance themselves from
religious institutions, leading to an over-representation of
disenchantment among non-religious individuals in cross-sectional
surveys. If we were to intervene to make the disenchanted re-affiliate
this might lead to greater loss of meaning.

Here, we use longitudinal data to emulate an idealised experiment, thus
providing a clearer window into the direction of causality (Hern√°n et
al. 2016; Bulbulia 2022; Hernan and Robins 2023)

\hypertarget{sample}{%

\subsubsection{Eligibility criteria}\label{eligibility-criteria}}

To emulate randomisation with observational data, we selected (1) those
participants who were identified as religious at the baseline wave
(NZAVS wave 2018) and who (2) reported a religious identification one
year later. There were 12,600 participants who met these criteria.

\hypertarget{disaffiation-rates}{%

As indicated in Table~\ref{tbl-transition}, of the 12600 people who were
religious at baseline, 1977 people dis-affiliated participants one year
later (NZAVS wave 2019), at the measurement year.\footnote{Cite our
  Markov paper showing that much religious change is probably
  artifactual.}

\hypertarget{assumptions-for-causal-inference}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions for causal
inference}\label{assumptions-for-causal-inference}}

To assess a causal effect we must contrast how the world would turn out
if we were to intervene. Generally, we cannot observe individual causal
effects because for any individual case, we only observe the
intervention or its absence. We cannot both intervene and not-intervene
at once. This is called the fundamental problem of causal inference
(Bulbulia 2022). Although we cannot generally observe unit-level causal
effects, it may be possible to estimate average causal effects. We do
this by contrasting the average effect in the exposed group with the
average effect in the unexposed unexposed group. For example, average of
the contrast (or equivalently the contrast of the the
averages)\footnote{Note that mathematically, the difference in the
  average expectation is equivalent to the average of the differences in
  expectation.} on the difference scale may be expressed:

\begin{alignat*}{2}
ATE & = E[Y(1)) - E(Y(0)]\\
& = E=[Y(1) - Y(0)]
\end{alignat*}

Estimating the average treatment effects (ATE) of binary exposures or
contrasts between different exposure levels involves understanding
causal inference as counterfactual data science. The ATE is expressed
as:

   \begin{align*}
    ATE = E[Y(a) - Y(a*)]
    \end{align*}

Our causal inference is grounded on three critical assumptions:

\hypertarget{identification-assumption-1-causal-consistency}{%
\paragraph{Identification assumption 1: Causal
consistency}\label{identification-assumption-1-causal-consistency}}

Causal consistency assumes the observed outcome aligns with the
potential outcome for a given exposure level:

\[Y^{observed} = AY(a=1) + (1-A)Y(a=0)\]

Observed outcomes can represent counterfactual outcomes under certain
exposures, such that:

\[
Y^{observed}_i = 
\begin{cases} 
Y_i(~a^*) & \text{if } A_i = a* \\
Y_i(~a~) & \text{if } A_i = a
\end{cases}
\]

Causal consistency also assumes no interference between unit treatments,
allowing potential outcomes to be set to the observed outcomes. For this
assumption to hold, we require ``treatment variation irrelevance.'' If
there are (1) well-defined outcomes for each treatment version, and (2)
no confounding effects, the multiple versions of treatments can be used
to estimate the causal effect:

\[K \coprod Y(k) | L\] or equivalently \[Y(k) \coprod K | L\]

Here, the treatement \(A\) is essentially a function of \(K\)
treatments, \(A = f(k_1...k_v)\) versions

Limitations exist, however, when interventions are ill-defined, or the
causal effect's interpretation is ambiguous. Put simply, given there are
unknown ways of becoming religiously disaffiliated the interpretation of
``disaffiliation'' may be strained. It is strained in the sense that we
would not know how to intervene to \emph{make} a religiously affiliated
person disaffiliate. We will return to this question in the discussion.

\hypertarget{identification-assumption-2-exchangability}{%
\paragraph{Identification assumption 2:
Exchangability}\label{identification-assumption-2-exchangability}}

Exchangability assumes treatment assignment is independent of potential
outcomes, given observed covariates. This is the ``no-confounding''
assumption that many psychologists have learned in association with
experimental design. In the setting of obervational data, we emulate
randomisation by conditioning on indicators that may lead to an
association of the exposure \(A\) and the outcome \(Y\) in the absence
of causation.

\[Y(a)\coprod  A|L\] or \[A \coprod  Y(a)|L\]

Where exchangability holds, we calculate the Average Treatment Effect
(ATE)

\[
ATE = E[Y(a*)|L = l] - E[Y(a)|L = l] 
\]

Put differently, conditioning on confounders ensures \emph{balance} in
their distribution across exposures.

\hypertarget{identification-assumption-3-positivity}{%
\paragraph{Identification assumption 3:
Positivity}\label{identification-assumption-3-positivity}}

Positivity is satisfied if there's a positive probability of receiving
or not receiving exposure at all covariate levels. Expressed as:

\begin{equation}
0 < \Pr(A=a|L)<1, ~ \forall a \in A, ~ \forall a \in L
\end{equation}

There are two types of positivity violation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Random non-positivity}: Occurs when the causal effect of a
  missing observation is presumed to exist. This violation is the only
  one verifiable by data. Here, we check and report it.
\item
  \textbf{Deterministic non-positivity}: Occurs when the causal effect
  is inconceivable. For example, the causal effect of hysterectomy in
  biological males violates deterministic non-positivity.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{identification-strategy}{%
\subsubsection{Identification Strategy}\label{identification-strategy}}

Effects must follow causes. To avoid the problems of reverse causation,
we measured outcomes during the year following the exposure (NZAVS wave
2020). We used doubly robust methods. These combine inverse probability
of treatment weights (propensity scores) with regression stratification.
There are two models at work in a doubly robust estimator.

\hypertarget{unconditional-doubly-robust-estimation-for-causal-effect-estimation}{%
\subsubsection{Unconditional Doubly Robust Estimation for Causal Effect
Estimation}\label{unconditional-doubly-robust-estimation-for-causal-effect-estimation}}

We use a Doubly Robust Estimation method, which effectively combines the
strengths of the IPTW and G-computation methods (see:
\href{https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-434-2023/content/09-content.html\#comprehensive-checklist-for-detailed-reporting-of-a-causal-inferenctial-study-e.g.-assessment-3-option-2}{here}.
The technique utilises both the propensity score and the outcome model,
making it ``doubly robust.'' This implies that if either of these models
is correctly specified, the estimation will not be biased.

\textbf{Step 1} The first step is to estimate the propensity score. The
propensity score, denoted as \(e(L)\), is the conditional probability of
the exposure \(A = 1\) given the covariates \(L\). The appropriate model
to estimate this can be chosen based on the nature of the data and the
exposure.

\[e = P(A = 1 | L) = f_A(L; \theta_A)\]

In this equation, \(f_A(L; \theta_A)\) is a function that estimates the
probability of the exposure \(A = 1\) given covariates \(L\). Here, we
use the \texttt{ebalance} method from the \texttt{clarify} package,
which we have found to ensure good balance on the confounders (see fig
below). We then calculate the weights for each individual, denoted as
\(v\), using the estimated propensity score:

\[
v = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{e} & \text{if } A = 1 \\
\frac{1}{1-e} & \text{if } A = 0 
\end{cases}
\]

Here, \(v\) depends on \(A\), and is calculated as the inverse of the
propensity score for exposed individuals and as the inverse of \(1-e\)
for unexposed individuals.

\textbf{Step 2} The next step involves fitting a weighted outcome model.
Using the weights computed from the estimated propensity scores, a model
for the outcome \(Y\), conditional on the exposure \(A\), is fitted.

\[ \hat{E}(Y|A, L; V) = f_Y(A, L ; \theta_Y, V) \]

In this model, \(f_Y\) is a function (in our case a weighted regression
model) with parameters \(Œ∏_Y\). The weights \(V\) are incorporated into
the estimation process, affecting the contribution of each observation
to the estimation of \(Œ∏_Y\), but they are not an additional variable in
the model. Additionally, following {``Agnostic Notes on Regression
Adjustments to Experimental Data: Reexamining Freedman{'}s Critique''}
(n.d.), we take the interaction of the exposure and baseline covariates
when estimating our regression model. For binary outcomes we model the
rate ratio using Poisson regression. Although binomial regression is
acceptable when the outcome is rare (less than 10\%), non-collapsability
leads means that we cannot interpret results as marginal causal effects.
For consistency we use the Poisson model with robust standard errors.

\textbf{Step 3} The third step is to simulate the potential outcome for
each individual under the hypothetical scenario where everyone is
exposed to the intervention \(A=a\), irrespective of their actual
exposure level:

\[\hat{E}(a) = \hat{E}[Y_i|A=a; L,\hat{\theta}_Y, v_i]\]

This expectation is calculated for each individual \(i\), with
individual-specific weights \(v_i\).

\textbf{Step 4} Finally, we estimate the average causal effect. We
compute the estimated expected value of the potential outcomes under
each intervention level:

\[\hat{\delta} = \hat{E}[Y(a)] - \hat{E}[Y(a')]\]

The difference \(\delta\) represents the average causal effect of
changing the exposure from level \(a'\) to level \(a\).

For standard errors and confidence intervals, we use simulation-based
inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023).

\end{figure}

As indicate in @ fig-results-health, the expected + one-year effect of
religious disaffiliation does not reliably affect health as subjectively
reported across NZAVS domains. However, we find that disaffilation is
causally associated with increases in both the average intensity and
frequency of alcohol consumption.

It has long been known that alcohol consumption can have damaging health
and social effects. However, it is unclear whether the changes we detect
here translate to other domains.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Here, we combined rigorous methods from causal epidemiology with
national scale time-series data to estimate the causal effects of
religious disaffiliation on multidimensional well-being. We used doubly
robust methods that combine propensity score weights with regression
stratification. By controlling for measures of all outcomes at baseline
we reduce the probability of unmeasured confounding. Because this cannot
be ensured, we report E-values, a sensitivity analysis that clarifies
the ``worst case'' scenario for an unmeasured confounder to explain away
the results.

\textbf{Health domain}: The expected +1 year effect of religious
disaffiliation is to increase both the average intensity and frequency
of alcohol consumption. We do not find reliable results on other health
domains.

\textbf{Embodied well-being domains}: We do not find reliable evidence
for a +1 year effect of religious disaffiliation on embodied will being
(i.e.~distress, fatigue)

\textbf{Practical well-being}: The expected +1 year effect of religious
disaffiliation is to diminish wishes for more self control. That is
good. However the one-year effect of disaffiliation is to increase
vengeful rumination. That is not good.

\textbf{Reflective well-being}: The expected +1 year effect of religious
disaffiliation is increase life satisfaction. That is good. However the
one-year effect of disaffiliation is to decrease a sense of purpose in
life. That is not good.

\textbf{Social well-being-being}: Disaffiliation is expected to cause
reduction in charitable giving and volunteering (consistent {[}cite a
different study{]}). However we do not find that disaffiliation as such
reduces other aspects of social well-being.

\paragraph{Income (waves: 1-3, 4-15)}\label{income-waves-1-3-4-15}}

Participants were asked ``Please estimate your total household income
(before tax) for the year XXXX''. To stablise this indicator, we first
took the natural log of the response + 1, and then centred and
standardised the log-transformed indicator.

\hypertarget{job-security-waves-1-34-79-15}{%

We assessed occupational prestige and status using the New Zealand
Socio-economic Index 13 (NZSEI-13) (Fahy, Lee, and Milne 2017). This
index uses the income, age, and education of a reference group, in this
case the 2013 New Zealand census, to calculate an score for each
occupational group. Scores range from 10 (Lowest) to 90 (Highest). This
list of index scores for occupational groups was used to assign each

\hypertarget{appendix-b.-multiple-comparisons-in-outcomewide-studies}{%
\subsection{APPENDIX B. Multiple comparisons in outcomewide
studies}\label{appendix-b.-multiple-comparisons-in-outcomewide-studies}}

The concern for multiple comparisons is legitimate in many research
settings. However, there are compelling reasons not to adjust for it in
the case of outcome-wide science, as proposed by Tyler VanderWeele
(VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Nature of the analysis:} Outcome-wide studies are inherently
  exploratory. They aim to generate hypotheses rather than testing
  pre-specified ones. In such a scenario, adjusting for multiple
  comparisons is out of place. Such testing might limit our ability to
  discover.
\item
  \textbf{False negatives vs.~false positives:} Adjusting for multiple
  comparisons often results in an increased risk of Type II errors
  (false negatives). In the context of public health, false negatives
  could be more problematic than false positives. We might overlook
  potentially significant associations that could lead to beneficial
  interventions.
\item
  \textbf{Independence of outcomes:} The standard corrections for
  multiple comparisons, such as the Bonferroni or the Holm method,
  assume that tests are independent. In an outcome-wide study, outcomes
  are likely to be correlated, so these corrections could be overly
  conservative.
\item
  \textbf{Magnitude of effects:} Outcome-wide studies do not only focus
  on p-values, but also the magnitude of effects, confidence intervals,
  and their scientific or clinical significance. We advocate assessing
  E-values, or unmeasured confounding, in place of assessing p-values.
  Adjusting for multiple comparisons focuses primarily on p-values,
  potentially undermining the importance of effect sizes. P-values are
  often a measure of sample size.
\item
  \textbf{Replication and robustness:} Findings from outcome-wide
  studies are not intended to be conclusive, but rather to guide further
  research. Consequently, potential false positives should be addressed
  in future replication studies and through robustness checks.
\end{enumerate}

In short, controlling for multiple comparisons makes sense in many
research settings. However, for outcome-wide studies, it may limit the
capacity to generate new hypotheses, increase the risk of missing
potential public health interventions, and over-emphasize p-values at
the expense of sensitivity analyses and E-values. In causal inference,
the main worry is assessing the robustness of results to unmeasured
confounding.
