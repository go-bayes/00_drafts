## Goals

### By the end of this seminar you will be able to:

1.  Consider ethical problems that cultural research might present.
2.  Understand the special problems that cultural research presents for **measurement.**
3.  Understand the concept of **confounding.**

### Key Concepts

1.  Measurement
2.  Validity
3.  A confounder

## Group discussion: Ethics brainstorm

1.  What are some ethical considerations that researchers need to take into account when conducting cross-cultural research? How do these considerations differ from those in other types of research?

2.  How can cultural differences in values and beliefs impact the ethical considerations in cross-cultural research? What are some examples of cultural differences that researchers need to be aware of?

3.  How can researchers ensure that their cross-cultural research is ethical, while still being scientifically rigorous and producing valuable insights? What are some best practices or guidelines that researchers can follow?
