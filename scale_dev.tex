We measured participants' levels of emotional regulation using three
items adpated from Gratz and Roemer
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gratz_multidimensional_2004}{2004}) and Gross
and John (\protect\hyperlink{ref-gross_individual_2003}{2003}): (1)
``When I feel negative emotions, my emotions feel out of control.''; (2)

We measured hours of exercising using one item from C. G. Sibley et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sibley2011}{2011}). We asked participants to
estimate and report how many hours they spend in exercise/physical
activity last week. To stablise this indicator, we first took the
natural log of the response + 1, and then centred and standardised the
log-transformed indicator.

\hypertarget{hours-of-work-waves-1-4-15}{%
\subsubsection{Hours of Work (waves: 1,
4-15)}\label{hours-of-work-waves-1-4-15}}

We measured hours of Work using one item from C. G. Sibley et al.

the square of the height in meters.

\hypertarget{disability-waves-5-15}{%
\subsubsection{Disability (waves: 5-15)}\label{disability-waves-5-15}}

We assessed disability with a one item indicator adapted from Verbrugge
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-verbrugge1997}{1997}), that asks ``Do you have a
health condition or disability that limits you, and that has lasted for
6+ months?'' (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

\hypertarget{fatigue-waves-5-15}{%
\subsubsection{Fatigue (waves: 5-15)}\label{fatigue-waves-5-15}}

Time, 2 = Some of The Time, 3 = Most of The Time, 4 = All of The Time).

\hypertarget{hours-of-sleep-waves-5-15}{%
\subsubsection{Hours of Sleep (waves:
5-15)}\label{hours-of-sleep-waves-5-15}}

\hypertarget{ethnic-group-impermeability-waves-9-13}{%
\subsubsection{Ethnic group impermeability (waves:
9-13)}\label{ethnic-group-impermeability-waves-9-13}}

We assessed ethnic group impermeability using one item from Mummendey
and Wenzel (\protect\hyperlink{ref-mummendey_social_1999}{1999}).
Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with
the statement (``The current income gap between New Zealand Europeans
and other ethnic groups would be very hard to change.''; 1 = Strongly
Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree).

\hypertarget{income-waves-1-3-4-15}{%
\subsubsection{Income (waves: 1-3, 4-15)}\label{income-waves-1-3-4-15}}

Participants were asked ``Please estimate your total household income
(before tax) for the year XXXX''. To stablise this indicator, we first
took the natural log of the response + 1, and then centred and
standardised the log-transformed indicator.

\hypertarget{kessler-6-waves-2-34-15}{%
\subsubsection{Kessler-6 (waves:
2-3,4-15)}\label{kessler-6-waves-2-34-15}}

We measured psychological distress using the Kessler-6 scale
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kessler2002}{R. ~C. Kessler et al. 2002}), which
exhibits strong diagnostic concordance for moderate and severe
psychological distress in large, cross-cultural samples
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kessler2010}{R. C. Kessler et al. 2010};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-prochaska2012}{Prochaska et al. 2012}).
Participants rated during the past 30 days, how often did\ldots{} (1)
``\ldots{} you feel hopeless''; (2) ``\ldots{} you feel so depressed
that nothing could cheer you up''; (3) ``\ldots{} you feel restless or
fidgety''; (4)``\ldots{} you feel that everything was an effort''; (5)
``\ldots{} you feel worthless''; (6) '' you feel nervous?'' Ordinal
response alternatives for the Kessler-6 are: ``None of the time''; ``A
little of the time''; ``Some of the time''; ``Most of the time''; ``All
of the time.''

\hypertarget{life-meaning-waves-10-15}{%
\subsubsection{Life Meaning (waves:
10-15)}\label{life-meaning-waves-10-15}}

makes my life meaningful. Participants indicated their agreement with
these items (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree).

\hypertarget{satisfaction-with-life-waves-1-34-15}{%
\subsubsection{Satisfaction with Life (waves:
1-3,4-15)}\label{satisfaction-with-life-waves-1-34-15}}

We measured life satisfaction with two items adapted from the
Satisfaction with Life Scale (\protect\hyperlink{ref-diener1985}{Diener
et al. 1985}): ``I am satisfied with my life'' and ``In most ways my
life is close to ideal''. Participants responded on a scale from 1
(Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).

\hypertarget{lost-job-waves-10-15}{%
\subsubsection{Lost Job (waves: 10-15)}\label{lost-job-waves-10-15}}

Participants were asked to indicate whether they lost their job or had
the principal earner in their household lose job in the last year (1 =
Yes, 0 = No).

\hypertarget{nz-deprivation-index-waves}{%
\subsubsection{NZ Deprivation Index (waves:
??)}\label{nz-deprivation-index-waves}}

We used the NZ Deprivation Index to assign each participant a score
based on where they live (\protect\hyperlink{ref-atkinson2019}{Atkinson,
Salmond, and Crampton 2019}). This score combines data such as income,
home ownership, employment, qualifications, family structure, housing,
and access to transport and communication for an area into one
deprivation score.

\hypertarget{national-well-being-index-waves-1-3-4-15}{%
\subsubsection{National Well-being Index (waves: 1-3,
4-15)}\label{national-well-being-index-waves-1-3-4-15}}

We measured participant's sense of national well-being by asking them to
``Please rate your level of satisfaction with the following aspects of
your life and New Zealand: (1) The economic situation in New Zealand,
(2) The social conditions in New Zealand, and (3) Business in New
Zealand'' on a scale from 0 (Completely Dissatisfied) to 10 (Completely
Satisfied) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-tiliouine2006}{Tiliouine, Cummins,
and Davern 2006}).

\hypertarget{nzsei-13-waves-8-15}{%
\subsubsection{NZSEI-13 (waves: 8-15)}\label{nzsei-13-waves-8-15}}

We assessed occupational prestige and status using the New Zealand
Socio-economic Index 13 (NZSEI-13)
