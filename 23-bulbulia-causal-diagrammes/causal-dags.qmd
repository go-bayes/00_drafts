## Abstract

## Introduction

Correlation is not causation. However, across many human sciences, persistent confusion in the analysis and reporting of correlations has limited scientific progress. The direction of causation frequently runs in the opposite direction to the direction of manifest correlations. This problem is widely known. Nevertheless, many human scientists report manifest correlations using hedging language. Making matters worse, widely adopted strategies for confounding control fail [@mcelreath2020], suggesting a "causality crisis" [@bulbulia2022]. Addressing the causality crisis is arguably among the human science's most pressing tasks.

When integrated into methodologically rigorous workflows, causal directed acyclic graphs ("DAGs", or "causal diagramms") can be powerful tools for clarifying causality.[^1] A system of formal mathematical proofs underpins their design. This brings confidence. No formal mathematical training is required to use them. This makes them accessible. However, causal inference relies on assumptions. Causal diagrammes are methods for encoding such assumptions. When assumptions are unwarrented, causal diagrammes may decieve. For example, when researchers lack time-series data unbiased causal effect estimates are generally not warrented [@vanderweele2015]. Cross-sectional researchers who use causal diagrammes to report their unrealistic assumptions use DAGS as props for unwarrented cover. Ideally causal diagrammes would be equipped with safety mechanisms that prevent such misapplications.

[^1]: The term "DAG" is unfortunate because not all directed acyclic graphs are causal. For a graph to be causal it must satisfy the conditions of markov factorisation (see Appendix A).

Here, I present a set of strategies for writing causal diagrammes that reduces the scope for unwarrented use. I call these *chronologically causal diagrammes*, and offer a tutorial for cultural evolutionary researchers on their use.

There are many excellent resources for causal diagrammes [@rohrer2018; @hernan2023; @cinelli2022; @barrett2021; @mcelreath2020].[^2]. One may reasonably ask whether another tutorial adds clutter. The approach I present here adds value in five ways.

[^2]: One of the best resources is Miguel Hernan's free course, here: <https://pll.harvard.edu/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-your-conclusions>.

In **Part 1.** , I present the counterfactual or "potential" outcomes framework that is necessary for conceptualising causality. In my view, the most serious obstacle to causal inference is a failure to understand that causal inference is not manifest data science, but rather what might be called **counterfactual data science.** Counterfactual data science consits of strategies for asking, and answering, quantitative quatestions about how the world might have been different from how it is. Without asking and answering counterfactual questions, we cannot quantitatively evaluate causal claims. In practice, experimental researchers employ counterfactual data-science. However, the assumptions that underpin such practices are rarely taught. No one should attempt to write a causal graph without understanding the counterfactual basis of quantitative causal inference.

In **Part 2**, I review the four elemental forms of confounding. Here I show how chronological causal diagrammes elucidate strategies for confounding control. A brief introduction examines

Although this discussion replicates material from other tutorials, by emphasising the benefits of temporal order in spatial organisation of a causal graph the conditions in which we may (or may not) identify causality in the presence of confounding become more apparent. Here, I briefly show how causal graphs may clarify poorly understood concepts of interaction, mediation, and repeated measures longitudinal data. Chronologically consciencious causal diagrammes help us to understand why commonplace modelling approaches such as multilevel modelling and structural equation modelling are often poorly suited to the demands of counterfactual data-science.

In **Part 3**, I explain how chronological causal diagrammes clarify mission-critical demands for data-collection in three-wave panel designs.

In **Part 4**, I focus on the problem of selection bias as it arises in a three-wave panel, using chronological causal diagrammes to focus attention on the imperatives for (a) adequate sampling and (b) longitudinal retention.

In **Part 5**, I focus on the problem of measurement error as it arises in a three-wave panel, again using chronological causal diagrammes to focus attention on the imperatives for (a) ensuring reliable measures, (b) assessing pathways for confounding from correlated and directed measurement errors.

Additional technical details are presented in Appendices.

## Part 1. The three fundamental identifiability assumption for counterfactual data science

Causal diagrammes are powerful tools for answering causal questions. However before we can answer a causal question we must first understand how to ask one. In this section I review key concepts and identification assumptions.

### The fundamental problem of causal inference

We say that $A$ causes $Y$ if changing $A$ would have made a difference to the outcome of $Y$. The use of the subjective "would have" reveals the need for counterfactual reasoning to conceive of causal effects. To infer a causality requires a contrast between how the world as it is and how the world might have been. "Causal inference" we aim to quantify the magnitude of differences between the world as it is, and the world as it might have been.

Suppose there are manifest correlations in the data between cultural beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity. Suppose further that we are interested in estimating the causal effect of belief in Big Gods on social complexity. We call beliefs in Big Gods the "exposure" or "treatment." We denote the exposure using the symbol $A$. We call social complexity the outcome, denoted by the symbol $Y$. For now, we assume the exposure, outcome, and the units (cultures) are well-defined. Later we shall relax these assumptions.

To assess causality we must define two counterfactual (or "potential") outcomes for each culture in a population of cultures:

-   $Y_i(a = 1)$: The social complexity of culture $i$ if they believed in Big Gods. This is the outcome when $A_i = 1$. This outcoome is counterfactual for culture$_i$, when the exposure $A_i = 0$.
-   $Y_i(a = 0)$: The social complexity of culture $i$ if they did not believe in Big Gods. This is the counterfactual outcome when $A_i = 0$. This outcoome is counterfactual for culture$_i$ when the exposure $A_i = 1$.

The causal effect of a belief in Big Gods on social complexity for culture$_i$ may be defined as a contrast on the difference scale between two potential outcomes ($Y_i(a)$) under the two different levels of the exposure ($A_i = 1$ (belief in Big Gods); $A_i = 0$ (no belief in Big Gods)). For simplicity we assume these exposures are exhaustive. Under these assumptions:

$$
\text{Causal Effect of Belief in Big Gods}_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) 
$$

Notice that to assess causality we require a contrast between two states of the world only one of which any culture might actually realise [^3] That is, when a culture receives one level of a belief in Big Gods the outcome under the other level(s) is ruled out. That the manifest data present only partial evidence for quantifying causal contrasts is called "the fundamental problem of causal inference"[@rubin1976; @holland1986]. Inferring counterfactual contrasts is a special case of a *a missing data problem* [@westreich2015; @edwards2015].

[^3]: The counterfactual outcome under the exposure $A = a$ may be written in different ways, such as $Y(a)$ (the notation we use here), $Y^{a}$, and $Y_a$.

#### Simulating average causal effects under different exposures and contrasting them requires a counterfactual data-science.

Although we cannot generally observe unit-level causal effects, it may be possible to estimate average causal effects. We do this by contrasting the average effect in the population *were all units in exposed group* with the average effect in the unexposed group *were all units unexposed* group. Suppose we are interested in estimating this contrast on the difference scale. We may write this as the difference of the (1) average outcome were everyone exposed to one level of the intervention and (2) average outcome were everyone exposed to one level of the intervention, or equivalently as the average of the differences.[^4]

[^4]: Note that mathematically, the difference in the average expectation is equivalent to the average of the differences in expectation.

```{=tex}
\begin{alignat*}{2}
ATE & = E[Y(1)) - E(Y(0)]\\
& = E=[Y(1) - Y(0)]
\end{alignat*}
```
The average treatment effects that we are interested in estimating need not be the effects of binary exposures. We may obtain contrasts between two different levels of a multinomial or continuous exposure. If we define the levels we wish to contrast as $A = a$ and $A = a*$. Then the average treatment effect is given by the expression:

```{=tex}
   \begin{align*}
    ATE = E[Y(a) - Y(a*)]
    \end{align*}
```
Recall that generally any unit-level causal effect is not identified in the data -- we only observe each unit under one or another exposure level. However, if the following three fundamental identification assumptions are credible, we may -- by assumption -- obtain these average (or "marginal" contrasts).

The three fundamental identification conditions for causal inference, when they obtain, allow researchers to recover the counterfactual contrasts necessary to compute causal effects from observed data. Not only does causal estimation rely on assumptions about the causal relationships that researchers hope to estimate, the data are generally insufficient to fully assess the fundamental identifibility assumptions on which causal estimation relies. Note that these assumptions are implicit in randomised experimental designs.

#### Identification Assumption 1: Causal Consistency

We satisfy the causal consistency assumption when the potential or counterfactual outcome under exposure $Y(A=a)$ corresponds to the observed outcome $Y^{observed}|A=a$.

<!-- The standard expression for counterfactual recovery (e.g. @morgan2014) is given:  -->

<!-- $$Y^{observed} = AY(a=1) + (1-A)Y(a=0)$$ -->

<!-- Where the assumption of causal consistency is tenable, we may obtain the missing counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical exposures as observed outcomes under realised exposures, such that: -->

Where the assumption of causal consistency is tenable, we say that the missing counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical exposures are equal to the observed outcomes under realised exposures. That is, by substituting $Y_{observed}|A$ for $Y(a)$ we may recover counterfactual outcomes required for our causal contrasts from realised outcomes under different levels of exposures. Notice that the causal consistency assumption reveals the priority of counterfactual outcomes over actual outcomes. It is the causal consistency assumption that allows us to obtain counterfactual outcomes from data (including experimetnal data).

We obtain the counterfactual outcomes by setting the observed outcomes to the counterfactual outcomes:

$$
Y^{observed}_i = 
\begin{cases} 
Y_i(~a^*) & \text{if } A_i = a* \\
Y_i(~a~) & \text{if } A_i = a
\end{cases}
$$

Under which conditions may we set the observed outcomes of an exposure to the counterfactual outcomes under that exposure?

First, we must assume no interference, such that for any units $i$ and $j$, $i \neq j$, that receive treatment assignments $a_i$ and $a_j$, the potential outcome for unit $i$ under treatment $a_i$ is not affected by the treatment assignment to unit $j$, thus:

$$Y_i(a_i, a_j) = Y_i(a_i, a'_j)$$

for all $a_j, a'_j$.

Put differently, causal consistency requires that the potential outcome for unit $i$ when it receives treatment $a_i$ and unit $j$ receives treatment $a_j$ is the same as the potential outcome for unit $i$ when it receives treatment $a_i$ and unit $j$ receives any other treatment $a'_j$. Thus, the treatment assignment to any other unit $j$ does not affect the potential outcome of unit $i$. Where there are dependencies in the data, such as in social networks, where potential outcomes differ depending on the treatment assignments of others causal consistency will typically be violated.

We might assume that in any study, and especially in observational studies, there are differences between versions of treatment $A$ that individuals receive. Given such differences, how might we ever substitute observed treatments with counterfactual treatments?

A more general formulation of the no-interference assumption is the assumption of "treatment variation irrelevance" [@vanderweele2009], which has been developed into the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment. According to this theory, where there are $K$ versions of treatment $A$, if each element of $K$ is sufficiently well-defined to correspond to well-defined outcome $Y(k)$, and if there is no confounding for the effect of $K$ on $Y$ given measured confounders $L$, then we may use $A$ to as a coarsened indicator to consistently estimate the causal effect of the multiple versions of treatment $K$ on $Y(k)$. We write $Y(k)$ is independent of $K$ conditional on $L$ [@vanderweele2009; @vanderweele2013; @vanderweele2018] as:

$$K \coprod Y(k) | L$$ or equivalently

$$Y(k) \coprod K | L$$

Given this independence, $A$ denotes a function over multiple interventions: $A = f(k_1\dots K)$ and we may obtain causally consistent estimates for $A$. The prome

Unfortunately, where interventions (the cultural vectors of belief) are not clearly defined, we cannot accurately assess the conditional independence assumption. Moreover, even if we may assume conditional independence holds for all versions of cultural belief, we might struggle to understand the causal effect we have estimated. For instance, consider the impact of belief in Big Gods within a culture at a specific time on subsequent social complexity, noting that there are potentially many mechanisms through which a culture adopts these beliefs, including through shared history, collective experiences, the evolution of religious institutions, charismatic leaders, and societal transformations. To estimate "the causal effect of belief in Big Gods within a culture" without specifying the mechanism through which the belief is adopted, leaves us uncertain about which effects we are consistently estimating, much less whether these effects can be generalized to cultures where the distribution of $k \in K$ belief adoption mechanisms differs. For example, if the distribution of beliefs arising from charismatic leadership exceeds that of the adoption of ritual systems, we might erroneously infer that belief in Big Gods in a culture invariably leads to social complexity. Given the variability in measured observational data, those studying cultures must appreciate the limitations of validating and interpreting their results. (We will return to this mission critical realisation in Part 2.).

Finally, again note that although causal consistency assumption allows us to link observed outcomes with counterfactual outcomes, half of the observations that we require to obtain causal contrasts remain missing. Consider an experiment in which assignment to a binary treatment $A = {0,1}$ is random. We observe the realised outcomes $Y^{observed}|A = 1$ and $Y^{observed}|A = 0$, By causal consistency, $(Y^{observed}|A = 1) = Y(1)$ and $(Y^{observed}|A = 0) = Y(0)$. Nevertheless, the counterfactual outcomes for the treatments that participants did not receive are missing.

$$
ATE = \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1)|A = 1]}_\text{observed} + \underbrace{E[Y(1)|A = 0]}_\text{unobserved}\bigg) - \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(0)|A = 0]}_\text{observed}  + \underbrace{E[Y(0)|A = 1]}_\text{unobserved}\bigg)
$$ We next turn to the exchangability assumption, which when satisifed allows us to impute those missing counterfactuals required for estimating causal effects.

We will next consider how the exchangability assumption allows us to recover the missing counterfactual outcomes.

#### Identification Assumption 2: Exchangability

When we assume exchangability, we assume that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, given a set of observed covariates. Or equivalently, when we assume exchangability conditional on observed covariates, we assume the treatment assignment mechanism does not depend on the unobserved potential outcomes. This condition is one of "exchangeability" because conceptually, were we to "exchange" or "swap" individual units between the exposure and contrast conditions the distribution of potential outcomes would remain the same. Put differently, we say there is balance between the treatment conditions in the confounders that might affect the outcome. Where $L$ is a measured covariate, exchangability may be expressed:

$$Y(a)\coprod  A|L$$

or equivalently:

$$A \coprod  Y(a)|L$$

Where such exchangability conditional on measured covariates holds, then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
ATE = E[Y(a*)|L = l] - E[Y(a)|L = l] 
\end{aligned}
$$

Although causal diagrammes or DAGs may be used to assess causal consistency assumption [@hernan2023b] and positivity assumption (no deterministic arrows in the DAG), their primary use is to clarify the conditions under which we may consistently estimate causal effects by conditioning on, or omitting, covariates to ensure conditional exchangeability.

#### Identification Assumption 3: Positivity

The positivity assumption is satisfied if there is a positive probability of receiving the exposure or non-receiving the exposure within every level of the the covariates. The probability of receiving every value of the exposure within all strata of co-variates is greater than zero is expressed:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
0 < \Pr(A=a|L)<1, ~ \forall a \in A, ~ \forall a \in L
\end{equation}
```
This assumption is crucial for causal inference because we cannot conceive of causal contrasts in the absence of the possibility for interventions. There are two types of positivity violations:

-   **Random non-positivity**: the casual effect of ageing with observations missing within our data, but may be assumed to exist. For example every continuous exposure will lack (infinitely many) realisations on the number line, yet we may nevertheless use statistical models to estimate causal contrasts. This assumption is the only identifiability assumption that can be verified by data. Although our task here is not to guide researchers on how to model their data, we note that it is important for applied researchers to verify and report whether random non-positivity is violated in their data.

-   **Deterministic non-positivity**: the causal effect is inconceivable. For example, the causal effect of hysterectomy in biological males violates deterministic non-positivity.

### The difficulty of satisfying causal consistency and positivity assumptions when considering historical dynamics.

Our ability to derive meaningful causal contrasts from the data hinges on meeting three fundamental identification assumptions: causal consistency, exchangeability, and positivity. Given the inherently complex and multifaceted nature of history, it is a formidable a challenge to satisfy these prerequisites.

Consider the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther's reformation in the 16th century led to the establishment of Protestantism. Many have argued that Protestantism caused social, cultural, and economic changes in those societies where it took hold (see: [@weber1905 @weber1993; @swanson1967; @swanson1971; @basten2013], for an overview see: [@becker2016]). Suppose we are interested in estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the Reformation.We denote the adoption of Protestantism by $A = a*$. We want to compare the effect of such adoption with remaining Catholic, ($A = a$). For the purposes of this example, we assume that economic development is well-defined. Say we define the outcome in units of GDP +1 century after a country becomes predominantly Prosetant (compared with remaining Catholic), $Y_i(a^*) - Y_i(a)$. For any country this effect is not identified, but if we can satisfy the fundamental assumptions we can estimate $\frac{1}{n} \sum_i^{n} Y_i(a*) - Y_i(a)$ and

$$ATE_{\textnormal{economic~development}} = E[Y(\textnormal{Became~Protestant}) - Y(\textnormal{Remained~Catholic})]$$

Consider the two of the three fundamental identification assumptions.

**Causal Consistency**: The Reformation happened in different ways and to varying degrees across European societies. We must assume that the Protestant "treatment" ($a*$ or $a$) is well-defined and consistent across these differences circumstances. Yet consider how variable these "treatments" were in the case of Reformation Europe. In England, for example, the establishment of Protestantism was closely tied to the royal crown. King Henry VIII instigated the English Reformation primarily to establish himself as the head of the Church of England, separate from the papal authority of the Catholic Church.

<!-- This shift had profound economic implications, notably the dissolution of monasteries, which transferred enormous wealth from the Church to the Crown and to secular landowners. The redistribution of these resources, along with the expansion of the English naval power, led to significant economic growth and the establishment of the early British Empire. -->

The birthplace of the Protestant Reformation was Germany. Here, Martin Luther's teachings emphasised individual faith and the interpretation of scriptures. Historians argue that this emphasis led to educational fervour, which, in turn, supported increases literacy rates, even among the lower classes. This emphasis on education is believed to have sparked economic development by creating a more skilled and literate workforce. There is certainly ample scope for variation in the "Protestant exposure." Even if the theory of causal inference under multiple versions may be applied, it is unclear what we mean by "the causal effect of Protestantism."

<!-- However, the Protestant Reformation also led to a series of religious wars in Germany that had devastating effects on its population and economy, perhaps tempering the economic benefits of increased education. -->

Not only is there ample scope for heterogeneity in the "Protestant exposure", there is also ample scope for interference. Or more accurately, interference would appear to be a concerning aspect of such heterogeneity: societies in the 16th century were not isolated; they were rather intertwined through complex networks of trade, diplomacy, and warfare. These networks were variously affected by religious alliances. The religious choices of one society were not independent of the economic development of others [^5]. Here too the consistency assumption would appear to fail.

[^5]: For example, consider the relationship between Spain and the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th centuries. Protestantism in the Netherlands sowed the seeds for its Eighty Years' War against Catholic Spain. This war drained Spain's wealth and led to economic decline, while the Netherlands, benefiting from the innovation and economic liberties that accompanied their version of Protestantism, became one of the most prosperous nations in Europe. Treatment effects are not clearly independent of each other.

**Positivity**: The positivity assumption requires that every unit at ever level of the measured confounders has a non-zero probability of receiving both treatment. The units in our example are European cultures that may adopt Protestantism or remain Catholic within some bounded period of time. However, historical context arguably creates deterministic patterns that challenge this assumption.\[\^target\] However it is not clear that Spain could have been randomly assigned to Protestantism, compromising estimation of for an Average Treatment Effect. It would seem here that estimating the average treatement effect in the treated make more conceptual sense:

$$ATT = E[(Y(a*)- Y(a))|A = a*,L]$$

Here, the ATT is the expected difference in economic success in the cultures that became Protestant contrasted with their expected economic success had those cultures not become Protestant, conditional on measured confounders $L$, among the exposed ($A = a^*$) . However, to estimate this causal contrast we would need to match Protestant cultures with comparable non-protestant cultures. It would be for historians and philosophers to consider whether matching is conceptually plausible.[^6]

[^6]: There are deeper questions about whether we can conceptualise cultures as random realisations of a draw from possible cultures, which we will not consider here.

<!-- Notice also that the specification of our causal question is vague. Miguel Hernán argues that to ask a causal question requires specifying an hypothetical randomised experiment, which, although perhaps implausible, clarifies the precise causal contrast in which we are interested. On how to state a causal question in reference to a target trial see:[@bulbulia2022]. We are setting this problem aside to focus on problems of evaluating the three fundamental identification assumptions.  -->

Setting to the side deeper conceptual questions about randomising cultures to treatment assignments, it should be apparent there are considerable difficulties in meeting the assumptions required for addressing the causal consistency and positivity assumptions.

Suppose we manage to satisfy ourself of these assumptions. Suppose there are no further conceptual questions about the measurement of variables that may induce an association between the exposure and the outcomes. We are then ready to employ causal diagrammes to assess the exchangebility assumption of no unmeasured confounding.

<!-- **Exchangeability** Let us assume that potential confounders may be balanced in the two conditions. For instance, political stability, which includes factors such as the consistency of leadership, social order, and the rule of law, can have profound effects both on a society's receptiveness to religious change and its economic development.  It is a confounder. How shall we operationalise it? Political stability in England under Henry VIII arguably differed both qualitatively and quantitatively with the stability of Sweden and Spain. It is unclear whether cultures could be considered exchangeable by such different measure of political stability. This is not to claim that we can never balance culture using measured covariates such as political stability, but only to underscore the conceptual challenges in doing so. These challenges arise in data rich settings, a point we will consider in *Part 4*. -->

<!-- During the Protestant Reformation, regional and geopolitical factors often played a large role in whether a society adopted Protestantism or remained Catholic, resulting in patterns that, on the face of it, constrain possibilities for religious change. We observe that many Northern European societies such as those in Scandinavia, parts of Germany, and England, were more inclined to adopt Protestantism. In contrast, Southern European societies like Italy, Spain, and Portugal remained predominantly Catholic. Why? -->

<!-- Consider Scandinavia, where Protestantism was widely adopted. The shift from Catholicism to Protestantism in this region was driven largely by the monarchies, which adopted Lutheran teachings almost uniformly. In Sweden, for instance, King Gustav Vasa championed the Reformation, in part to decrease the influence of the Catholic Church and consolidate his own power. As a result, Protestantism was adopted throughout his kingdom, virtually ensuring that everyone in Sweden was exposed to Protestantism. In this seeting, it is unclear how we could randomly assign Catholicism to Sweden. Doing so would appear to violate the positivity assumption. By contrast, consider Spain, where staunch support of Catholicism by the Spanish monarchy and the central role of the Inquisition in enforcing Catholic orthodoxy would appear to have constrained the adoption of Protestantism. Again, it is unclear how we could randomly assign religion to these countries, much less think of the assigments as clearly defined interventions. From the historical record, it does not appear credible to assume that Protestantism was possible for Spain any more than we can assume hystorectimes are possible for men. -->

<!-- 1. **Causal Consistency**: The causal consistency assumption might be violated if the 'treatment' (religious exposure) is not consistently defined. For instance, consider two individuals who identify as Christians. While both are exposed to Christianity, the 'version' of Christianity they practice could vary based on factors like denomination (e.g., Catholic, Protestant), personal beliefs, and local cultural practices. If these versions of the treatment have different effects on the outcome of interest (say, moral attitudes), then the causal consistency assumption is violated because the treatment (religious exposure) is not consistently defined across individuals. -->

<!-- 2. **Exchangeability**: The exchangability assumption might be violated if there are unmeasured confounders that affect both the treatment and the outcome. For example, consider the effect of religion (Christianity vs. Islam) on a particular outcome such as charitable giving. There could be unmeasured confounders like community influence or family traditions that influence both the religion one practices and the propensity to give to charity. If these confounders are not measured and controlled for, the exchangability assumption is violated, and the observed association between religion and charitable giving may not represent a causal association. -->

<!-- 3. **Positivity**: The positivity assumption might is violated if there are deterministic 'treatments' due to historical and geographical context. For example, someone born in a predominantly Muslim country like Saudi Arabia will almost certainly grow up practicing Islam, a deterministic 'treatment' that violates the positivity assumption. Similarly, someone born in Vatican City, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, will almost certainly grow up practicing Catholicism. In these cases, the historical and geographical context leads to near-absolute probabilities of certain religious exposures, violating the positivity assumption. -->

<!-- In all these cases, the historical and geographical context, which heavily influences cultural traits such as religion, can lead to violations of the causal consistency, exchangability, and positivity assumptions. Just as history can constrain cultural evolution and lead to violations of these assumptions, it can also lead to violations of other key assumptions in causal inference. -->

<!-- In cultural evolution, the scope for violation of deterministic non-positivity would appear to be rather wide, because the constraints are history are arguably rather strong. For example, the language one speaks, a cultural trait, is heavily influenced by one's historical and geographical context. For example, someone born in rural Japan will almost certainly grow up speaking Japanese, a deterministic 'treatment' that violates the positivity assumption. History places substantial constraints on cultural evolution, often leading to near-absolute probabilities of certain cultural exposures such as language, arising from one's place and history. This arguably leads to widespread violations of deterministic non-positivity for many questions cultural evolution. -->

<!-- bias when estimating contrasts between counterfactual outcomes from observational data. -->

<!-- The data that we observe only give us insight into the counterfactual outcomes to be contrasted under the identifying assumptions of causal consistency, exchangeability, and positivity. When we ask a causal question we are must state our exposure question, outcome(s), and the variables that lead to an association between them, and these variables must correspond to well-defined features in our data. We cannot generally test the assumptions of "no-unmeasured confounding," and so must take every effort to examine unmeasured sources of bias. Only after we have stated our causal question may we use causal diagrammes to assist in answering that question. -->

## Part 2. Causal diagrammes

#### Variable Naming Conventions

**Outcome (Y)**: The outcome ($Y$), often referred to as the "effect," should be distinctly defined in any causal diagram. For instance, instead of ambiguously stating "the causal effect of the Protestant Reformation on economic success," be specific, such as "the +100 year effect on adjusted GDP after a country transitioned to a Protestant majority." By doing so, you might reveal the limitations or challenges of causal inference, including conceptual incoherence, lack of relevance, or data deficiencies.

**Exposure or Treatment (A or X)**: The "exposure" or "treatment" refers to the "cause" in a causal relationship and is typically denoted by $A$ or $X$. It's imperative that the exposure is clearly defined and doesn't violate deterministic non-positivity. A precise understanding of the intervention allows us to accurately assess how outcomes might vary had the intervention been different.

**Measured Confounders (C or L)** Measured confounders, often denoted by $C$ or $L$, are variables that when adjusted for, minimize or remove the non-causal association between exposure $A$ and outcome $Y$. To simplify a causal graph, variables with similar functions are often grouped under a single symbol. For instance, if $\text{male} \to A, Y$ and $\text{age} \to A, Y$, we can say $\bf{L} \to A, Y$, where $\bf{L}$ is a set that includes the variables $\text{male}$ and $\text{age}$ ($\{\text{male, age}\}\in \bf{L}$).

**Unmeasured Confounders (U)** Unmeasured confounders ($U$) are variables that influence both exposure $A$ and outcome $Y$, but are not measured or adjusted for in the analysis. This could potentially introduce bias in estimating the causal effect of $A$ on $Y$. In a causal graph, unmeasured confounders might be represented as $U \to A, Y$. This underlines the necessity for sensitivity analyses to estimate the influence of unmeasured confounders on your findings.

**Selection Variables (S)** Selection variables ($S$) affect the inclusion of units in the study. They are important to consider as they could introduce selection bias in your study. In causal diagrams, selection is often represented with a box around the variable, like so: $\framebox{S}$.

**Mediators (M)** Mediators ($M$) are variables that are influenced by exposure and subsequently affect the outcome. This can be represented as $A \to M \to Y$. Unless you are specifically interested in mediation, do not adjust for a mediator when estimating the total effect of $A$ on $Y$.

**Interactions (A, B, Y)** Interactions are considered when the combined effects of two variables $A$ and $B$ on the outcome $Y$ differ from their separate effects, or if the effect of $A$ on $Y$ varies across levels of $B$. These are typically represented as $A \to Y; B \to Y$. Note that causal graphs do not represent non-linear effects; they are used to assess bias from confounding.

### Initial Rules of Thumb

1.  **Define All Variables Clearly**: Ensure that all variables in your causal diagramme are distinctly defined.

2.  **Define Novel Conventions**: If you are using unique conventions in your diagram, such as coloured arrows to indicate induced confounding, make sure to define them.

3.  **Embrace Minimalism**: Include only the nodes and edges that clarify the problem at hand. Diagrams should be used when they provide clarity beyond what can be achieved by textual descriptions alone. That clarity is enhance by drawing only as much complexity as is needed to identify sources of counfounding and develop strategies for minimising bias.

4.  **Maintain Chronological Order**: Organize nodes in temporal sequence, usually from left to right or top to bottom. If depicting repeated measures, use time subscripts for clarity. Note that a chronologically ordered causal diagramme is an ordinary causal diagramme whose spatial properties help to improve strategies for addressing bias in causal estimation. They are not structurally different from non-chronologically ordered causal diagrammes. However, we shall see that by maintaining chronological order we may greatly enhance the effectiveness of the tool.

5.  **Time-Stamp Your Nodes**: It is often useful to time-stamp nodes for clearer temporal understanding, for example, $L_{t0} \rightarrow A_{t1} \rightarrow Y_{t2}$.

6.  **Account for Non-random Exposures**: When exposures are not assigned randomly, assume the existence of unmeasured confounding. Plan for sensitivity analyses to gauge the impact of unmeasured confounding on your findings.

7.  **Include Nodes for Selection Variables**: When applicable, include nodes for selection variables. This helps to understand potential sources of selection bias in your study.

8.  **Consider Mediators and Interactions**: When mediation or interaction is of interest, these should be appropriately represented in the diagram. However, be mindful not to attempt to represent non-linear relationships graphically.

9.  **Appreciate the Qualitative Role of DAGs**: Remember, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) serve as qualitative visual tools rather than quantitative models. When strategies like time stamps are implemented, they are used for maintaining sufficient clarity in chronological order needed to understand potential confounding. They need not denote specific time intervals. Again we should aim for simplicity in our causal DAGs - include only the level of detail necessary to elucidate strategies for controlling confounding.

In the following section, we describe the core strength of causal diagrams: their ability to vividly demonstrate that controlling for confounding effectively necessitates blocking all 'back door' paths linking the exposure and the outcome, while avoiding conditioning a mediators.

## Elemental counfounds

There are four elemental confounds [@mcelreath2020 p.185]. Here we consider how chronological conscientiousness in the graph assists with tasks of confounding control.

### 1. The problem of confounding by common cause

The problem of confounding by common cause arises when there is a variable denoted by $L$ that influences both the exposure, denoted by $A$ and the outcome variable, denoted by $Y.$ Because $L$ is a common cause of $A$ and $Y$, $L$ may create a statistical association between $A$ and $Y$ that does not reflect a causality. For example, people who smoke may have yellow fingers. Smoking causes cancer. Because smoking ($L$) is a common cause of yellow fingers ($A$) and cancer ($Y$), $A$ and $Y$ will be associated. However, intervening to change the colour of people's fingers would not affect cancer. The dashed red arrow in the graph indicate bias arising from the open backdoor path from $A$ to $Y$ that results from the common cause $L$.

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of cauasality

Confounding by a common cause can be addressed by adjusting for it. Typically we adjust through through statistical models such as regression, matching, or inverse probability of treatment weighting. Again, it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to describe causal estimation techniques. Figure @fig-dag-common-cause-solution clarifies that any confounding that is a cause of $A$ and $Y$ will precede $A$ (and so $Y$), because causes precede effects. By indexing the the nodes on the graph, we can see that confounding control typically requires time-series data.

```

### 2. Confounding by collider stratification (conditioning on a common effect)

Conditioning on a common effect occurs when a variable $L$ is affected by both the treatment $A$ and an outcome $Y$.

Suppose $A$ and $Y$ are initially independent, such that $A \coprod Y(a)$. Conditioning on the common effect $L$ opens a backdoor path between $A$ and $Y$, possibly inducing an association. This occurs because $L$ gives information about the relationship of $A$ and $Y$. Here's an example:

Let $A$ denote "beliefs in Big Gods". Let $Y$ denote "social complexity". Let $L$ denote "economic trade". Suppose, "beliefs in Big Gods" and "social complexity" are not causally linked. However, they both affect "economic trade", and if we condition on "economic trade" in a cross-sectional study, we might find a statistical association between "beliefs in Big Gods" and "social complexity" even in the absence of causation.

We denote the observed associations as follows:

-   $P(A = 1)$: Probability of beliefs in Big Gods
-   $P(Y = 1)$: Probability of social complexity
-   $P(L = 1)$: Probability of economic trade

Without conditioning on $L$, we have:

$$P(A = 1, Y = 1) = P(A = 1)P(Y = 1)$$

However, if we condition on $L$ (the common effect of both $A$ and $Y$), we find:

$$P(A = 1, Y = 1 | L = 1) \neq P(A = 1 | L = 1)P(Y = 1 | L = 1)$$

The common effect $L$, once conditioned on, creates a non-causal association between $A$ and $Y$. This can mislead us into believing there is a direct link between beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity, even in the absence of such a link. Without time-series data measured on the units of analysis, if we only observe $A$, $Y$, and $L$ and compute correlations, we might erroneously conclude that there is a causal relationship between $A$ and $Y$. This is the collider stratification bias.[^7]

[^7]: When $A$ and $Y$ are independent, the joint probability of $A$ and $Y$ is equal to the product of their individual probabilities: $P(A = 1, Y = 1) = P(A = 1)P(Y = 1)$. When we condition on $L$, however, the joint probability of $A$ and $Y$ given $L$ is not necessarily equal to the product of the individual probabilities of $A$ and $Y$ given $L$, hence the inequality as described.

```

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of cauasality, and show this in your causal graph

To address the problem of conditioning on a common effect, we should generally ensure that all confounders $L$ that are common causes of the exposure $A$ and the outcome $Y$ are measured before the occurence of the exposure $A$, and furthermore that the exposure $A$ is measured before the occurence of the outcome $Y$. If such temporal order is preserved, $L$ cannot be an effect of $A$, and thus neither of $Y$. By measuring all relevant confounders before the exposure, researchers can minimise the scope for collider confounding by conditioning on a common effect. This rule is not absolute.[^8]. In the case of the example just described, we would require time-series data with accurate measures in a sufficiently large sample of cultures prior to the introduction of certain religious beliefs, and the cultures would need to be independent of each other.[^9]

[^8]: However, as indicated in @fig-dag-descendent-solution, it may be useful in certain circumstances to condition on a confounder that occurs after the outcome has occurred.

[^9]: The independence of cultural units was at the centre of the study of comparative urban archeaology throughout from the late 19th [@decoulanges1903] and 20th century [@wheatley1971]. Despite attention to this problem in recent work (e.g. [@watts2016]), there is arguably greater "head-room" for understanding the need for conditional independence in recent cultural evolutionary studies.

### M-bias: conditioning on a collider that occurs before the exposure may introduce bias

Typically (with exceptions described below), indicators for confounders should included only if they are known to be measured before their exposures. However, researchers should be also cautious about over-conditioning on pre-exposure variables that are not associated with both the exposure and confounder, as doing so can induce confounding. As shown in @fig-m-bias, collider stratification may arise even if $L$ occurs before $A$. This happens when $L$ does not affect $A$ or $Y$, but may be the descendent of a unmeasured variable that affects $A$ and another unmeasured variable that also affects $Y$. Conditioning on $L$ in this scenario evokes what is called "M-bias." If $L$ is not a common cause of both $A$ and $Y$, or the effect of a shared common cause, $L$ should not be included in a causal model. \@fig-m-bias presents a case in which $A \coprod Y(a)$ but $A \cancel{\coprod} Y(a)| L$. The solution: do not condition on the pre-exposure variable $L$.

#| label: fig-m-bias

### 3 The problem of conditioning on a mediator

Conditioning on a mediator occurs when $L$ lies on the causal pathway between the treatment $A$ and the outcome $Y$. Conditioning on $L$ can lead to biased estimates by blocking or distorting the total effect of $A$ and $Y$.

Let $A$ denote "beliefs in Big Gods", $Y$ denote "social complexity", and $L$ denote "economic trade". Suppose that "beliefs in Big Gods" directly influences "economic trade", and "economic trade" in turn influences "social complexity". Here, $L$ ("economic trade") acts as a mediator for the effect of $A$ ("beliefs in Big Gods") on $Y$ ("social complexity").

If we condition on $L$ ("economic trade"), we could potentially bias our estimates of the total effect of $A$ ("beliefs in Big Gods") on $Y$ ("social complexity"). This is because conditioning on $L$ will typically attenuate the direct effect of $A$ on $Y$ as it "blocks" the indirect path through $L$, as presented in @fig-dag-mediator.

On the other hand, if $L$ is a collider between $A$ and an unmeasured confounder $U$, then including $L$ may increase the strength of association between $A$ and $Y$. This happens because conditioning on a collider can induce an artificial association between the variables influencing the collider, as presented in @fig-dag-descendent.

In either case, unless one is interested in mediation analysis, conditioning on a post-treatment variable is nearly always a bad idea. Such conditioning will distort our understanding of the total causal effect of $A$ on $Y$. If we cannot ensure that $L$ is measured before $A$, and if $A$ may affect $L$ we run the risk of mediator bias.

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of causality

To mitigate the issue of mediator bias, particularly when our focus is on total effects, we should avoid conditioning on a mediator. This can be achieved by ensuring that the mediator $L$ takes place before the treatment $A$ and the outcome $Y$. This underlines the significance of explicitly stating the temporal ordering of our variables, as demonstrated in our causal diagram. By including time indexing of all variables in our causal diagramme, and by clearly labelling mediators (e.g. with $M_t$), we reduce the potential for mediator bias from over-conditioning.[^10]

[^10]: Like most rules, this rule isn't without exceptions. If $L$ is associated with $Y$ but cannot be caused by $A$, conditioning on $L$ will often enhance the precision of the estimate for the causal effect of $A$ on $Y$. This holds true even if $L$ occurs after $A$. However, the onus is on us to explain that the post-treatment factor cannot be a consequence of the exposure. We consider post-treatment conditioning next.

\end{tikzpicture}
```

### 4. Conditioning on a descendant

Say $L$ is a cause of $L^\prime$. According to Markov factorisation, if we condition on $L$ we partially condition on $L^\prime$.

There are both negative and positive implications for causal estimation in real-world scenarios.

First the negative. Suppose there is a confounder $L^\prime$ that is caused by an unobserved variable $U$, and is affected by the treatment $A$. Suppose further that $U$ causes the outcome $Y$. In this scenario, as described in @fig-dag-descendent, conditioning on $L^\prime$, which is a descendant of $A$ and $U$, can lead to a spurious association between $A$ and $Y$ through the path $A \to L^\prime \to U \to Y$.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-descendent
#| fig-cap: "Confounding by Descent: The red dashed arrow illustrates the introduction of bias due to the opening of a 'backdoor' path between the exposure (A) and the outcome (Y) when conditioning on a descendant of a confounder. This failure to maintain d-separation in the association between the exposure and the outcome leads to potential bias in the causal inference."

```

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of causality, and use expert knowledge of all relevant nodes.

Ensuring the confounder ($L^\prime$) is measured before the exposure ($A$) has two benefits.

First, if $L^\prime$ is a confounder, that is, if $L^\prime$ is a variable which if we fail to condition on it will bias the association between treatment and outcome, the strategy of including only pre-treatment indicators of $L\prime$ will reduce bias. @fig-dag-descendent-solution presents this strategy

\draw [-latex, draw=blue, dotted] (A) to (Y);
\draw [-latex, bend right=50, draw =black] (U) to (Y);


\end{tikzpicture}

```

Second, note that we may use descendent to reduce bias. For example, if an unmeasured confounder $U$ affects $A$, $Y$, and $L^\prime$, then adjusting for $L^\prime$ may help to reduce confounding caused by $U$. This scenario is presented in @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2. Note that in this graph, $L^\prime$ may occur *after* the exposure, and indeed after the outcome. This shows that it would be wrong to infer that merely because causes preceed effects, we should only condition on confounders that preceed the exposure.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-descendent-solution-2
#| fig-cap: "Solution: conditioning on a confounder that occurs after the exposure and the outcome may address a problem of unmeasured confounding if the confounder is a descendent of a prior common cause of the exposure and outcome. The dotted paths denote that the effect of U on A and Y is partially adjusted by conditioning on L', even though L' occurs after the outcome. The dotted blue represents suppressing bias. For example a genetic factor that affects the exposure and the outcome early in life might be measured by an indicator late that is expressed (and may be measured) later in life. Adjusting for such and indicator would constitute an example of post-outcome confounding control."

### Causal Interaction

In applied research, the assessment of evidence for interaction often holds significant importance. However, to properly approach this concept, it is crucial to distinguish between causal interaction and effect modification.

#### Causal interaction as two independent exposures

Causal interaction is the effect of two exposures that may occur jointly or separately (or not occur). We say there is interaction on the scale of interest when the effect of one exposure on an outcome depends on the level of another exposure. For example, the effect of a beliefs in Big Gods (exposure A) on social complexity (outcome Y) might depend on whether a culture has monumental architecture (exposure B), which in turn might also affect social complexity. Evidence for causal interaction on the difference scale would be present if:

$$\bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1,1)]}_{\text{joint exposure}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}}\bigg) - \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1,0)]}_{\text{only A exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}}- \underbrace{E[Y(0,1)]}_{\text{only B exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}} \bigg) \neq 0 $$

Which simplifies to:

$$ \underbrace{E[Y(1,1)]}_{\text{joint exposure}} - \underbrace{E[Y(1,0)]}_{\text{only A exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,1)]}_{\text{only B exposed}} + \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}} \neq 0 $$

If the quantity on the left hand side is greater than zero there is evidence for positive interaction; if it is less than zero there is evidence a sub-additive effect; if this quantity is indistinguishable from zero there is no evidence for interaction.[^11]

[^11]: Note that the causal effects of interactions often differ when measured on the ratio scale. This can have important policy implications, see: [@vanderweele2014] . Although beyond the scope of this article, when evaluating evidence for causality we must clarify the measure of effect in which we are interested (see: .

When writing a causal diagram, we represent the two exposures as separate nodes and draw edges from them to the outcome, as show in @fig-dag-interaction. This is because causal diagrams are non-parametric; they represent the qualitative aspects of causal relationships without making specific assumptions about the functional form of these relationships.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-interaction
#| fig-cap: "Causal interaction: if two exposures are causally independent of each other, we may wish to estimate their individual and joint effects on Y, where the counterfactual outcome is Y(a,b) and there is evidence for additive or subadditive interaction if E[Y(1,1) - Y(0,1) - Y(1,0) + Y(0,0)] ≠ 0. If we cannot conceptualise B as a variable upon which there can be intervention, then the interaction is better conceived as effect modification (see next figure). Important: DAGs are not parametric so to express interaction do not draw a path into another path"

#### **Causal Interaction Considered as Effect Modification**

In exploring effect modification, our focus is the variation in the impact of a single exposure on an outcome across diverse levels of another variable.

Under this scenario, we presume independence of the counterfactual outcome conditional on measured confounders, within strata of covariate $G$, where $G$ is an effect modifier:

$$Y(a) \coprod A | L, G$$

Observe that only one counterfactual outcome requires evaluation here, i.e., \$E\[Y(a\*)\|L, G = g\]-E\[Y(a)\|L, G = g\]\$. It's important to remember that **causal graphs are not parametric, so to represent interaction, do *not* draw a path intersecting another path**.

### Advice for causal mediation

The assumptions for causal mediation are strict. Chronologically conscientious DAGs can help us to spot both the promise, and perils, of attempting causal mediation.

1.  **No unmeasured exposure-outcome confounders given** $L$

    This assumption is denoted by $Y(a,m) \coprod A | L1$. It implies that when we control for the covariate set $L1$, there are no additional unmeasured confounders that influence both the cultural beliefs in Big Gods $A$ and the social complexity $Y$. For instance, if we are studying the effect of cultural beliefs in Big Gods (exposure) on social complexity (outcome), and geographic location and historical context are our covariates $L$, this assumption would mean including measures of these confounders is sufficient to account for the subsequent association betwen A and Y. The relevant confounding path is coloured brown in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

2.  **No unmeasured mediator-outcome confounders given** $L$

    This assumption is denoted by $Y(a,m) \coprod M | L2$. It implies that when we control for the covariates $L2$, there are no unmeasured confounders that influence both political authority $M$ and social complexity $Y$. For instance, suppose that trade networks affect both political authority and social complexity. If this is so, then we must condition on trade networks to block the otherwise open path linking our mediator and outcome. And we must assume no other confounders of the mediator outcome path. This confounding path is coloured blue in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

3.  **No unmeasured exposure-mediator confounders given** $L$

    This assumption is denoted by $M(a) \coprod A | L3$. It implies that when we control for the covariates $L$, there are no unmeasured confounders that influence both the cultural beliefs in Big Gods $A$ and political authority $M$. Say technology to build large ritual theaters, may influence both beliefs in Big Gods and the level of political authority. Suppose further that we have indicators of this technology measured prior to the emergence of Big Gods. Call these indicators $L3$. To estimate unbiased natural mediated effects, we must assume that conditioning on $L3$ is sufficient to block the backdoor path betwen the exposure and the mediator. This confounding path is coloured green in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

4.  **No mediator-outcome confounder affected by the exposure (no red arrow)**

This assumption is denoted by $Y(a,m) \coprod M^{a*} | L$. It implies that there are no variables that confound the relationship between political authority and social complexity that are affected by the cultural beliefs in Big Gods. For example, if we are studying the effect of cultural beliefs in Big Gods (exposure) on social complexity (outcome) mediated by political authority (mediator), this assumption would mean that there are no factors, like trade networks ($L2$), that influence both political authority and social complexity that are affected by the cultural belief in Big Gods. This confounding path is coloured red in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions. Note this is a very stringent assumption to make. If the exposure affects a confounder of the mediator and outcome then we face the following dilemma. If we do not condition on the this confounder the backdoor path between the mediator and the outcome will remain open. So we condition. However, in doing so, we partially block the path between the exposure and the mediator. This leads to bias. Hence, the natural direct and indirect effects cannot be identified from the manifest data. This remains so even if we were to possess perfect measures of the relevant confounders. Again, the conditions for counterfactual data science are more stringent than those for manifest data science. However, we can fix the mediator to certain levels and investigate controlled direct and indirect effects. Such questions may be relevant to science and policy. As an example, If trade were disrupted by war, what would be the causal effects of Big Gods on Social Complexity? Such questions require the application of G-methods, which the following section considers in greater detail. For now, we have seen how chronologically ordered causal graphs clarify the demands on mediation analysis for addressing causal questions.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-mediation-assumptions
#| fig-cap: "Assumptions for mediation analysis. The brown edges denote the path for common causes of the exposure and coutcome. To block this path we must condition on L1.  The green edges denote the path for common causes of the exposure and mediator. To block this path we must condition on L3.  The blue edges denote the path for common causes of the mediator and outcome. To block this path we must condition on L2. The red path denotes the effect of the exposure on the confounder of the mediator and outcome. If any such path exists then we cannot obtain natural direct and indirect effects. Conditioning on L2 is necessary to prevent mediator outcome confounding but doing so blocks the effect of the exposure on the mediator."

### Advice for modelling repeated exposures in longitudinal data (confounder-treatment feedback)?

Causal mediation is a special case in which we have multiple sequential exposures.

For example, consider temporally fixed multiple exposures. The counterfactual outcomes may be denoted $Y(a_{t1} ,a_{t2})$. There are four counterfactual outcomes corresponding to the four fixed "treatment regimes":

1.  **Always treat (Y(1,1))**: This regime involves providing the treatment at every opportunity.

2.  **Never treat (Y(0,0))**: This regime involves abstaining from providing the treatment at any opportunity.

3.  **Treat once first (Y(1,0))**: This regime involves providing the treatment only at the first opportunity and not at subsequent one.

4.  **Treat once second (Y(0,1))**: This regime involves abstaining from providing the treatment at the first opportunity, but then providing it at the second one.

There are six causal contrasts that we might compute for the four fixed regimes, presented in @tbl-regimes.[^12]

[^12]: We compute the number of possible combinations of contrasts by $C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!}$

| Type     | Description                            | Counterfactual Outcome |
|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Regime   | Always treat                           | Y(1,1)                 |
| Regime   | Never treat                            | Y(0,0)                 |
| Regime   | Treat once first                       | Y(1,0)                 |
| Regime   | Treat once second                      | Y(0,1)                 |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Never treat           | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(0,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Treat once first      | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(1,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Treat once second     | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(0,1)\]   |
| Contrast | Never treat vs. Treat once first       | E\[Y(0,0) - Y(1,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Never treat vs. Treat once second      | E\[Y(0,0) - Y(0,1)\]   |
| Contrast | Treat once first vs. Treat once second | E\[Y(1,0) - Y(0,1)\]   |

: Table describes four fixed treatment regimes and six causal contrasts in time series data where the exposure may vary. {tbl-regimes}

We might also consider treatment to be a function of the previous outcome. For example, we might **Treat once first** and then **treat again** or **do not treat again** depending on the outcome of the previous treatment. This is called "time-varying treatment regimes."

Note that to estimate the "effect" of a treatment regime, we must compare the counterfactual quantities of interest. The same conditions that apply for causal identification in mediation analysis apply to causal identification in multiple treatment settings. And notice, just as mediation opens the possibility of time-varying confounding (condition 4, in which the exposure effects the confounders of the mediator/outcome path), so too we find that with time-varying treatments comes the problem of time-varying confounding. Unlike traditional causal mediation analysis, the sequence of treatment regimes that we might consider is indefinitely long.

Temporally organised causal graphs again help us to discover the problems with traditional multi-level regression analysis and structural equation modelling. Suppose we are interested in the question of whether beliefs in big Gods affect social complexity.

First consider fixed regimes. Suppose we have well-defined concept of social complexity and excellent measurements over time. Suppose we want to compare the effects of beliefs on big Gods on Social complexity using historical data measured over two centuries. Our question is whether the introduction and persistence of such beliefs differs from having no such beliefs. The treatment strategies are: "always believe in big Gods" versus "never believe in big Gods" on the level of social complexity. Consider @fig-dag-9. Here, $A_{tx}$ represents the cultural belief in "Big Gods" at time $x$, and $Y_{tx}$ is the outcome, social complexity, at time $x$. Economic trade, denoted as $L_{tx}$, is a time-varying confounder because it varies over time and confounds the effect of $A$ on $Y$ at several time points $x$. To complete our causal diagramme we include an unmeasured confounder $U$, such as oral traditions, which might influence both the belief in big Gods and social complexity.

We know that the level of economic trade at time $0$, $L_{t0}$, influences the belief in "big Gods" at time $1$, $A_{t1}$. We therefore draw an arrow from $L_{t0}$ to $A_{t1}$. But we also know that the belief in "big Gods", $A_{t1}$, affects the future level of economic trade, $L_{t(2)}$. This means that we need to add an arrow from $A_{t1}$ to $L_{t(2)}$. This causal graph represents a feedback process between the time-varying exposure $A$ and the time-varying confounder $L$. This is the simplest graph with exposure-confounder feedback. In real world setting there would be more arrows. However, our DAG need only show the minimum number of arrows to exhibit the problem of exposure-confounder feedback. (We should not clutter our causal graphs: only provide the essential details.)

What happens if we were to condition on the time-varying confounder $L_{t3}$? Two things would occur. First, we would block all the backdoor paths between the exposure $A_{t2}$ and the outcome. We need to block those paths to eliminate confounding. Therefore, conditioning on the time-varying confounding is essential. However, paths that were previously blocked would not be pen. For example, the path $A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{t(4)}$, which was previous closed is opened because the time varying confounder is the common effect of $A_{t1}$ and $U$. Conditioning opens the path $A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{3}$. Therefore we must avoid conditioning on the time varying confounder. We are damned-if-we-do-or-do-not condition on the confounder that is affected by the prior exposure.

As with mediation, however, is may be possible to use simulation to obtain controlled effects. Models for assessing such controlled causal effects of time-fixed and time-varying exposures belong to a class of methods called "G-methods." There has been tremendous development in the applications of G-methods in the health sciences. However, such methods have yet to be widely employed by cultural evolutionary researchers. Causal graphs are important because they help to clarify the fact that standard methods -- including multi-levels models -- will inevitably fail to recover causal effects from time-series data in which there is treatment confounder feedback.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-9
#| fig-cap: "Exposure confounder feedback is a problem for time-series models. If we do not condition on L_t2, a backdoor path is open from A_t3 to Y_t4. However, if conditioning on L_t2 introduces collider bias, opening a path, coloured in red,  between A_t2 and Y_t4. Here, we may not use conventional methods to estimate the effects of multiple exposures.  Instead, at best, we may only simulate controlled effects using G-methods. Multi-level models will eliminate bias. Currently, outside of epidemiology, G-methods are rarely used. Causal graphs are useful for clarifying the damned either way confounding control strategies that lead traditional methods to fail."

A similar problem arises when the time-varying exposure and time-varying confounder share a common cause. The problem arises even without the exposure affecting the confounder.

#| label: fig-dag-time-vary-common-cause-A1-l1

In this setting, to address causal questions, we may only use simulation based G-methods. Causal graphs are useful in spotting problems for identifying causal effects in manifest data (even when perfectly measured)."

The problem becomes accute when the exposures $A_{t1}$ affects the outcome $Y_{t4}$. Consider: because $L_{t2}$ is along the path from $A_{t1}$ to $Y_{t4}$ conditioning on $L_{t2}$ partially blocks the path between the exposure and the outcome. Conditioning on $L_{t2}$ in this setting induces both collider stratification bias and mediator bias. Yet we must condition on $L_{t2}$ to block the open backdoor path between $L_{t2}$ and $Y_{t4}$. The general problem of exposure-confounder feedback is described in [@hernan2023b]. This problem presents a serious issue for cultural evolutionary studies. The bad news is that nearly traditional regression based methods cannot address this problem. Causality is not identified from time-series data with feedback. The good news, again, is that we may obtain controlled effect estimates in these settings using G-methods. The scope and application of these methods is beyond the scope of this tutorial.[^13]

[^13]: Relatedly, to assess the identification of controlled effect estimates benefits from graphical methods such as "single world intervention graphs" or "SWIGS." SWIGS represent counterfactual outcomes on the graph. However, in their general form, SWIGS are templates and not causal graphs. Their application, too, is beyond the scope of this tutorial see: [@richardson2013]

### Summary Part 2

To estimate causal effects we must contrast the world as it has been with the world as it might have been. For many big questions in cultural evolution, we have seen confounder-treatment feedback leads to intractable identification problems. We have also seen that causal graphs are useful for clarifying these problems. I next turn to three-wave designs for estimating the total causal effects. Such designs have applications for a broad class of cultural evolutionary questions, and may be especially useful for evolutionary anthropologists who wish to collect time-series data in the present to address causal questions about cultural evolution as it is occurring in the world today.

## Part 3. Applications

In this section, we explore how temporally ordered causal diagrams can illuminate the utility of a three-wave panel design for addressing causal questions using data. With three waves of data we can begin to improve our understanding of causality. Here is how.

### **Define the exposure(s)**

First we require a well-defined exposure. For example, suppose we are interested in the causal effect of church attendance. We must state the exposure. Do we mean some attendance versus no-attendance? Do week mean weekly attendance verse monthly attendance? To assess causality we need to state a causal contrast, and the scale of this contrast. To clarify the exposure it is again useful to imagine a hypothetical experiment which although not feasible, would, if performed, generate data that would clarify the focus of our interest. In a three wave panel design, the exposure is measured in the second wave.

### **Define the outcomes(s)**

Next we require a well-defined outcome. For example, we might be interested in the +1-year effect of church attendance on weekly volunteering (some vs none) or effect of church attendance on annual charitable giving. Note that there is vague concepts such as "the prosocial effects of religion" take use nowhere towards understanding causality. We must state what we mean by religion by specifying an intervention, and we we must state what wee mean by "prosocial effect" by stating a measurable outcome that occurs after the intervention. In a three wave panel design, the outcomes are measured in the third wave, that is, the wave after the exposure.

### **Identify all measurable common causes of the exposure and the outcome**

Next we must identify every covariate that, if conditioned on, can close or diminish the strength of any non-causal association between the exposure and outcome. In a three wave panel design, the confounders are typically measured in the baseline wave, that is, the wave prior the exposure. As noted in @fig-dag-mediator-solution by measuring confounders prior to the exposure we reduce the prospects for mediation bias.

### **Collect data for proxy variables of unmeasured common causes at the baseline wave**:

If there are any unmeasured factors that influence both the exposure and outcome, but we don not have direct measurements for them, we should try to include a proxy for these, as described in @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2.

### **Collect data for the exposure(s) at baseline**

As indicated in @fig-dag-3-dd, adjusting for the baseline exposure assesses the effect of the "incident exposure" rather than the "prevalent exposure" [@danaei2012; @hernan2023]. This setup ensures that any unmeasured confounder would have to influence both the outcome and initial exposure, irrespective of previous exposure levels, to explain an observed exposure-outcome association. Additionally, we more effectively emulate a controlled trial by assessing incident exposure.

\draw [-latex, black] (L) to (A);

\end{tikzpicture}

```

### **Collect data for the outcome(s) at baseline**:

It is also vital to control for the outcome measured at baseline -- the 'baseline outcome'. This strategy aims reduces the prospects for reverse causation by ensuring that the cause-effect relationship follows the right temporal order. Hence, along with a rich set of covariates, the baseline outcome should be included in the covariate set to make the confounding control assumption as plausible as possible. The baseline measurement is often strongest confounder affecting both the exposure and subsequent outcome. (For a detailed account of confounding control in three-wave panel designs see @vanderweele2020)

### **State the population for whom the causal question applies**

We need to define for whom our causal inference applies. For this purpose, it is useful to distinguish the concepts of source and target population, and between the concepts of generalisability and transportability.

The **source population** is the population from whom our sample is drawn. The **target population** is the larger group for which we aim to apply our study's results. The closer the source matches the target in ways that are relevant to our causal questions, the stronger our causal inferences about the target population will be.

**Generalisability** refers to the ability to apply the causal effects estimated from a sample to the source population. In simpler terms, it deals with the extrapolation of causal knowledge from a sample to the broader population. This concept is also called "external validity".

$$\text{Generalisability} = PATE \approx ATE_{\text{sample}}$$

Where the $PATE$ is a population average treatment effect. Although beyond the scope of this study, we may use post-stratification weights to obtain the PATE such that

$$PATE =  f(ATE_{\text{source}}, W)$$

where $f(.,W)$ denotes a survey weighting function.

**Transportability** refers to the ability to extrapolate causal effects learned from a source population to a target population when certain conditions are met. It pertains to the transfer of causal knowledge across different settings or populations.

$$\text{Transportability} = ATE_{\text{target}} \approx f(ATE_{\text{source}}, T)$$

where $f$ is a function and $T$ is a function that maps the results from our source population to another population. To achieve transportability, we need information about the source and target populations and an understanding of how the relationships between treatment, outcome, and covariates differ between the populations. Assessing transportability requires scientific knowledge.

Confounding control by three-wave panel designs may be summarised in @fig-dag-6.

### A practical case

Supposes we are interested in the causal effects of religious service attendance on cooperative outcomes such as charitable giving and volunteering. When comparing groups that attend service with those that do not, we notice that religious service attendance is associated with greater donations of money and time. We are aware that associations in the manifest data are poor guides to causation. Those who attend religious service might be richer, and therefore more capable of giving. They might be older, and so have more time to volunteer. There might be gender imbalances that account for these differences. Those who are more charitable might be more disposed to remain religious (about which we will say more in Section 4). Those who are religious might be more included to reporting biases about charity (about which we will say more in section 5). Note that being charitable might also cause people to retain their religion, perhaps by increasing their contact with co-religionists who are volunteering time and money through religious outreach.

## Part 5. Measurement and confounding in the three wave panel design.

### Undirected uncorrellated measurement error under the null

1.  **Non-Differential Measurement Error:** This type of error is unrelated to the levels of the exposure or outcome. Simply put, the inaccuracies in measuring the exposure or outcome don't depend on the actual levels of these variables. It's "non-differential" because the errors do not "differ" based on the level of exposure or outcome. This means that they are just as likely to overestimate as they are to underestimate the true values.

2.  **Uncorrelated Measurement Error:** Uncorrelated (or non-dependent) measurement error refers to a situation where the measurement errors of the exposure and the outcome are not related to each other. That is, a mistake in measuring the exposure doesn't predict a mistake in measuring the outcome, and vice versa.

When these two types of error are present at the same time, the effect of the exposure on the outcome can be underestimated, which is known as "attenuation bias". This happens because the 'noise' (the measurement errors) dilutes the 'signal' (the true relationship between exposure and outcome).

However, if the null hypothesis is true (i.e., there's no real relationship between the exposure and outcome), this won't introduce bias. This is because, with non-differential and uncorrelated errors, mistakes are equally likely to be in any direction. Since the true effect is zero under the null, the average estimated effect from many repeated studies would also be zero, despite the presence of these measurement errors.

Still, while there won't be bias under the null, measurement error can increase the variability of your estimates (making them less precise) and reduce the statistical power of your study (making it harder to detect a true effect if one exists). We next turn to this case.

If there is a true effect of the exposure on the outcome, non-differential measurement error in both the exposure and the outcome can lead to an attenuation of the effect estimate. This phenomenon is often referred to as "regression dilution bias" or "attenuation bias".

Take a moment to understand these concepts. Non-differential measurement error refers to the situation where the measurement error does not differ based on the level of exposure or the outcome. It's called "non-differential" because the degree of error doesn't "differ" based on these factors.

When it comes to independent non-differential measurement error, it means that the errors in the measurements of exposure and outcome are uncorrelated with each other, and they don't depend on the true values of exposure and outcome.

Now, if there's a true effect of the exposure on the outcome, the presence of measurement error in both variables can lead to attenuation bias, because the effect size is underestimated due to the 'noise' introduced by these errors.

When you measure the exposure or outcome with error, the variability of these variables increases, thus the signal (i.e., the true relationship) gets 'diluted' in the increased 'noise'. This can lead to an underestimation of the true effect size.

The more severe the measurement error, the greater the attenuation of the estimated effect. In other words, the observed relationship between the exposure and the outcome will be weaker than the true relationship, potentially leading to a failure to detect a true association.

However, it's important to mention that the degree of this attenuation can depend on various factors, including the extent of the measurement error, the strength of the true relationship, and the statistical method used. Some statistical methods have been developed to correct for this type of bias, such as regression calibration, simulation extrapolation (SIMEX), and multiple imputation (citations)

Consider a study that seeks to use this dataset to investigate the effect of regular exercise on psychological distress. In contrast to previous graphs, let us allow for latent reality to affect our measurements, as well as the discrepencies between our measurements and true underlying reality. We shall use @fig-dag-uu-null as our initial guide.

We represent the true exercise by $\eta_A$. We represent true psychological distress by $\eta_Y$. Let $\eta_L$ denote a persons true workload, and assume that this state of work affects both levels of excercise and psychological distress.

To bring the model into contact with measurement theory, Let us describe measurements of these latent true underlying realities as functions of multiple indicators: $L_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}$, $A_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}$, and $Y_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}$. These constructs are measured realisations of the underlying true states. We assume that the true states of these variables affect their corresponding measured states, and so draw arrows from $\eta_L\rightarrow{L_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}}$, $\eta_A\rightarrow{A_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}}$, $\eta_Y\rightarrow{Y_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}}$.

We also assume unmeasured sources of error that affect the measurements: $U_{L} \rightarrow$ $L_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}$, $U_{A} \rightarrow$ $A_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}$, and $U_{Y} \rightarrow$ $Y_{f(X_1\dots X_n)}$. That is, we allow that our measured indicators may "see as through a mirror, in darkness," the underlying true reality they hope to capture (Corinthians 13:12). We use $U_{L}$, $U_{A}$ and $U_{Y}$ to denote the unmeasured sources of error in the measured indicators. These are the unknown, and perhaps unknowable, darkness and mirror.

Allow that the true underlying reality represented by the $\eta_{var}$ may be multivariate. Similarly, allow the true underlying reality represented by $U_{var}$ is multivariate.

We now have a causal diagramme that more precisely captures VanderWeele's thinking as presented in @fig-dag-multivariate-reality-complete. In our @fig-dag-uu-null, we have fleshed out $\mathcal{R}$ in a way that may include natural language concepts and scientific language, or constructs, as latent realities and latent unmeasured sources of error in our constructs.

The utility of describing the measurement dynamics using causal graphs is apparrent. We can understand that the measured states, once conditioned upon create *collider biases* which opens path between the unmeasured sources of error and the true underlying state that gives rise to our measurements. This is depicted by a the arrows $U_{var}$ and from $\eta_{var}$ into each $var_{f(X1, X2,\dots X_n)}$

Notice: **where true unmeasured (multivariate) states are related to true unmeasured (multivariate) sources of error in the measurement of those states, the very act of measurement opens pathways to confounding.**

If for each measured construct $var_{f(X1, X2,\dots X_n)}$, the sources of error $U_{var}$ and the unmeasured consituents of reality that give rise to our measures $\eta_{var}$ are uncorrelated with other variables $U\prime_{var}$ and from $\eta\prime_{var}$ and $var\prime_{f(X1, X2,\dots X_n)}$, our estimates may be downwardly biased toward the null. However, d-separation is preserved. Where errors are uncorrelated with true latent realities, there is no new pathway that opens information between our exposure and outcome. Consider the relations presented in @fig-dag-dep-udir-effect-confounders-3wave

```

Here,

$\eta_L \rightarrow L$: We assume that the true workload state affects its measurement. This measurement, however, may be affected by an unmeasured error source, $U_{L}$. Personal perceptions of workload can introduce this error. For instance, a person may perceive their workload differently based on recent personal experiences or cultural backgrounds. Additionally, unmeasured cultural influences like societal expectations of productivity could shape their responses independently of the true workload state. There may be cultural differences - Americans may verstate; the British may present effortless superiority.

$\eta_A \rightarrow A$: When it comes to exercise, the true state may affect the measured frequency (questions about exercise are not totally uninformative). However, this measurement is also affected by an unmeasured source of error, which we denote by $U_{A}$. For example, a cultural shift towards valuing physical health might prompt participants toreport higher activity levels, introducing an error, $U_{A}$.

$\eta_Y \rightarrow Y$: We assume questions about distress are not totally uninformative: actual distress affects the measured distress. However this measurement is subject to unmeasured error: $U_{Y}$. For instance, an increased societal acceptance of mental health might change how distress is reported creating an error, $U_{Y}$, in the measurement of distress. Such norms, moreover, may change over time.

$U_{L} \rightarrow L$, $U_{A} \rightarrow A$, and $U_{Y} \rightarrow Y$: These edges between the nodes indicate how each unmeasured error source can influence its corresponding measurement, leading to a discrepancy between the true state and the measured state.

$U_{L} \rightarrow U_{A}$ and $U_{L} \rightarrow U_{Y}$: These relationships indicate that the error in the stress measurement can correlate with those in the exercise and mood measurements. This could stem from a common cultural bias affecting how a participant self-reports across these areas.

$\eta_A \rightarrow U_{Y}$ and $\eta_L \rightarrow U_{A}$: These relationships indicate that the actual state of one variable can affect the error in another variable's measurement. For example, a cultural emphasis on physical health leading to increased exercise might, in turn, affect the reporting of distress levels, causing an error, $U_{Y}$, in the distress measurement. Similarly, if a cultural trend pushes people to work more, it might cause them to over or underestimate their exercise frequency, introducing an error, $U_{A}$, in the exercise measurement.

### Confounding control by baseline measures of exposure and outcome: Dependent Directed Measurement Error in Three-Wave Panels

1.  We propose a three-wave panel design to control confounding. This design adjusts for baseline measurements of both exposure and the outcome.

2.  Understanding this approach in the context of potential directed and correlated measurement errors gives us a clearer picture of its strengths and limitations.

3.  This three-wave panel design incorporates baseline measurements of both exposure and confounders. As a result, any bias that could come from unmeasured sources of measurement errors should be uncorrelated with their baseline effects.

4.  For instance, if individuals have a social desirability bias at the baseline, they would have to develop a different bias unrelated to the initial one for new bias to occur due to correlated unmeasured sources of measurement errors.

5.  However, we cannot completely eliminate the possibility of such new bias development. There could also be potential new sources of bias from directed effects of the exposure on the error term of the outcome, which can often occur due to panel attrition.

6.  To mitigate this risk, we adjust for panel attrition/non-response using methods like multiple imputation. We also consistently perform sensitivity analyses to detect any unanticipated bias.

7.  Despite these potential challenges, it is worth noting that by including measures of both exposure and outcome at baseline, the chances of new confounding are significantly reduced.

8.  Therefore, adopting this practice should be a standard procedure in multi-wave studies as it substantially minimizes the likelihood of introducing novel confounding factors.

### Comment on slow changes

Over long periods of time we can expect additional sources of confounding. Changes in cultural norms and attitudes can occur over the duration of a longitudinal study, leading to residual confounding. For example, if there is a cultural shift towards increased acceptance of mental health issues, this might change how psychological distress is reported over time, irrespective of baseline responses.

<!-- It's also important to consider that cultural influences might not be entirely captured by the survey. Factors such as societal expectations, shared beliefs, and norms within a culture could influence both exercise behaviour and distress states. These could change over time due to sociocultural shifts, and if these changes aren't accounted for, could lead to residual confounding. For example, a societal shift towards valuing physical health might encourage more exercise independently of baseline responses -->

<!-- 1.  **Baseline Measures and Cultural Differences:** The NZAVS contains data from diverse cultural backgrounds. Therefore, controlling for baseline measures of exercise and distress would also help account for cultural differences that might influence these variables at the outset. For instance, certain cultural groups might have different baseline physical activity or baseline distress states due to various socio-cultural factors. -->

<!-- 2.  **Residual Confounding and Exercise:** Let's consider the construct $\eta_{A}$, representing the true state of exercise behaviour. If we control for baseline exercise, we're adjusting for the initial state of this behaviour. However, there could still be cultural factors that impact how exercise changes over time. For instance, a cultural event or festival that significantly increases physical activity for a certain period might occur. This change might be independent of the baseline state of exercise, thus leading to residual confounding. -->

<!-- 3.  **Residual Confounding and Depression:** Similarly for $\eta_{Y}$, the true state of Depression/Anxiety. Controlling for baseline states adjusts for the initial emotional state. However, cultural factors such as societal norms or expectations about emotional expression could change over time independently of the baseline distress. These changes could result in residual confounding. For example, a significant cultural event might induce communal feelings of joy or sadness, influencing the distress state irrespective of the baseline level. -->

<!-- 4.  **Unmeasured Cultural Factors**: It's also important to consider that cultural influences might not be entirely captured by the survey. Factors such as societal expectations, shared beliefs, and norms within a culture could influence both exercise behaviour and distress states. These could change over time due to sociocultural shifts, and if these changes aren't accounted for, could lead to residual confounding. For example, a societal shift towards valuing physical health might encourage more exercise independently of baseline responses -->

<!-- 5.  **Change over time**: Finally, time itself can be a factor. Changes in cultural norms and attitudes can occur over the duration of a longitudinal study like the NZAVS. If the timing of these changes isn't aligned with the measurement times, this can also lead to residual confounding. For example, if there is a cultural shift towards increased acceptance of mental health issues, this might change how mood is reported over time, irrespective of baseline responses. -->

<!-- 6.  **Directed Measurement Error:** Consider a situation where individuals from certain cultural backgrounds might systematically under-report their physical activity due to societal norms or expectations, introducing a directed measurement error. Similarly, reporting of mood states might also be influenced by cultural perspectives on expressing emotions. These culturally influenced errors in measurement can introduce bias, even after controlling for baseline measures. -->

<!-- 7.  **Undirected Measurement Error:** Undirected errors could also occur due to random variations in understanding or interpreting survey questions across different cultures, introducing variability in the data. If these random errors correlate with the error in measuring other variables (for instance, if misunderstanding of exercise questions correlates with misunderstanding of mood questions), this can introduce bias. -->

<!-- 8.  **Correlated Errors and Cultural Differences:** The culturally influenced measurement errors ($U_{A}$, $U_{Y}$) could be correlated, as the cultural factors influencing the reporting of exercise might also influence the reporting of mood. This correlation between errors introduces further complexity and potential bias. -->

<!-- 9.  **Residual Confounding:** Despite controlling for baseline measures, there can still be residual confounding due to unmeasured cultural factors. For instance, even if we control for baseline exercise and mood, there might still be cultural factors that impact the changes in these variables over time independently of the baseline measures. -->

<!-- In short, controlling for baseline measures in the NZAVS helps to reduce some bias and account for cultural differences that influence the exposure and outcome. However, potential bias due to unmeasured confounding and measurement error, for example, if these are influenced by cultural factors, still remain. -->

10. **Need for Sensitivity Analysis** The Key takehome message is that we must always perform sensitivity analyses because we can never be certain that our confounding control strategy has worked.

## Stray points to address

1.  Structural equation models are not causal diagrammes
2.  Causal diagrammes are non-parametric
3.  Causal diagrammes represent interactions $A -- > Y <--- B$ (two arrows into the outcome)
4.  We may distinguish between effect modification and interaction.

### ELSE (for conclusion)

-   Where possible do experiments, but we cannot always perform experiments\
-   No multi-level models
-   Good measures
-   Retention
-   Check positivity -- how many change.
-   (causation not all of science)
-   (need for assumpitions)
-   Causal estimation is not all of science. And it is not all of causality.
-   Curse of dimensionality
-   Tracking change

Although this article does not covxer methods of estimation, it is crucial to notice that causal inference requires something more than data science. Causal inference would be better described as *counterfactual data science*. This is because we estimate causal effects using simulated or counterfactual states of the world in which everyone in a population received the treatment-level of the exposure contrasted with simulated or counterfactual states of the world in which everyone in the same population recieved the contrast or control level of the exposure. As mentioned, individual causal effects cannot be generally identified from the data. However, when the three fundamental identification conditions have been satisfied may we link counterfactual outcomes to observed data to simulate counterfactual causal contrasts for the population of interest, or the "target population." To repeat the contrasts required for causal inference are between hypothetical states of the world. For this reason, we say that causal inference is *counterfactual data-science*.

## Appendix 1 how causal diagrammes work

Key concepts are as follows:

-   **Markov Factorisation:** Pertains to a causal diagramme in which the joint distribution of all nodes can be expressed as a product of conditional distributions. Each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants, given its parents. This is crucial for identifying conditional independencies within the graph.

-   **D-separation (direction separation):** Pertains to a condition in which there is no path between some sets of variables in the graph, given the conditioned variables. Establishing d-separation allows us to infer conditional independencies between the exposure and counterfactual outcomes, which in turn help identify the set of measured variables we need to adjust for in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect.

### Assumption of causal diagrammes

The **Causal Markov Condition** is an assumption that each variable is independent of its non-descendants, given its parents in the graph. If two variables are correlated, it is because one causes the other, or because both share a common cause, not because of any confounding variables not included in the graph

Formally, for each variable $A$ in the graph, $A$ is independent of its non-descendants NonDesc($X$), given its parents Pa($X$).

This is strong assumption. Typically we must assume that there are hidden, unmeasured confounders that introduce dependencies between variables, which are not depicted in the graph. \*\*It is important to (1) identify known unmeasured confounders and (2) label them on the the causal diagramme.

#### **Faithfulness**

The **Faithfulness** assumption is the inverse of the Causal Markov Condition. It states that if two variables are uncorrelated, it is because there is no direct or indirect causal path between them, not because of any cancelling out of effects. Essentially, it assumes that the relationships in your data are stable and consistent, and will not change if you intervene to change some of the variables.

Formally, if $A$ and $Y$ are independent given a set of variables $L$, then there does not exist a set of edges between $A$ and $Y$ that remains after conditioning on $L$.

As with the *Causal Markov Condition*, *Faithfulness* is a strong assumption, and it might not typically hold in the real world. There could be complex causal structures or interactions that lead to apparent independence between variables, even though they are causally related.

Perhaps not all is lost. VanderWeele looks to the theory of multiple versions of treatment for solace.

Recall, a causal effect is defined as the difference in the expected potential outcome when everyone is exposed (perhaps contrary to fact) to one level of a treatment, conditional on their levels of a confounder, with the expected potential outcome when everyone is exposed to a a different level of a treatement (perhaps contrary to fact), conditional on their levels of a counfounder.

$$ \delta = \sum_l \left( \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a,l] - \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a^*,l] \right) P(l)$$

where $\delta$ is the causal estimand on the difference scale $(\mathbb{E}[Y^0 - Y^0])$.

In causal inference, the multiple versions of treatment theory allows us to handle situations where the treatment isn not uniform, but instead has several variations. Each variation or "version" of the treatment can have a different effect on the outcome. However, consistency is not violated because it is redefined: for each version of the treatment, the outcome under that version is equal to the observed outcome when that version is received. Put differently we may think of the indicator $A$ as corresponding to many version of the true treament $K$. Where conditional independence holds such that there is a absence of confounding for the effect of $K$ on $Y$ given $L$, we have: $Y(k)\coprod A|K,L$. This states conditional on $L$, $A$ gives no information about $Y$ once $K$ and $L$ are accounted for. When $Y = Y(k)$ if $K = k$ and Y$(k)$ is independent of $K$, condition on $L$, then $A$ may be thought of as a coarsened indicator of $K$, as shown in @fig_dag_multiple_version_treatment_dag. We may estimate consistent causal effects where:

$$ \delta = \sum_{k,l} \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a,l) P(l) - \sum_{k,l} \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a^*,l) P(l)$$

The scenario represents a hypothetical randomised trial where within strata of covariates $L$, individuals in one group receive a treatment $K$ version randomly assigned from the distribution of $K$ distribution $(A = 1, L = l)$ sub-population. Meanwhile, individuals in the other group receive a randomly assigned $K$ version from $(A = 0, L = l)$

This theory finds its utility in practical scenarios where treatments seldom resemble each other -- we discussed the example of obesity last week (see: [@vanderweele2013]).

### Reflective and formative measurement models may be approached as multiple versions of treatment

Vanderweele applies the following substitution:

$$\delta = \sum_{\eta,l} \mathbb{E}[Y_\eta|l] P(\eta|A=a+1,l) P(l) - \sum_{\eta,l} \mathbb{E}[Y_\eta|l] P(\eta|A=a,l) P(l)$$

Specifically, we substitue $K$ with $\eta$ from the previous section, and compare the measurement response $A = a + 1$ with $A = a$. We discover that if the influence of $\eta$ on $Y$ is not confounded given $L$, then the multiple versions of reality consistent with the reflective and formative statistical models of reality will not lead to biased estimation. $\delta$ retains its interpretability as a comparison in a hypothetical randomised trial in which the distribution of coarsened measures of $\eta_A$ are balanced within levels of the treatment, conditional on $\eta_L$.

This connection between measurement and the multiple versions of treatment framework provides a hope for consistent causal inference varying reliabilities of measurement.

However, as with the theory of multiple treatments, we might not known how to interpret our results because we don't know the true relationships between our measured indicators and underlying reality.

How can we do better?

## Appendix 3. Measurement and psychometric research.

In psychometric research, formative and reflective models describe the relationship between latent variables and their respective indicators.

### Reflective Model (Factor Analysis)

In a reflective measurement model, also known as an effect indicator model, the latent variable is understood to cause the observed variables. In this model, changes in the latent variable cause changes in the observed variables. Each indicator (observed variable) is a 'reflection' of the latent variable. In other words, they are effects or manifestations of the latent variable. These relations are presented in @fig-dag-latent-1.

The reflective model may be expressed:

$$X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$$

Here, $X_i$ is an observed variable (indicator), $\lambda_i$ is the factor loading for $X_i$, $\eta$ is the latent variable, and $\varepsilon_i$ is the error term associated with $X_i$. It is assumed that all the indicators are interchangeable and have a common cause, which is the latent variable $\eta$.

In the conventional approach of factor analysis, the assumption is that a common latent variable is responsible for the correlation seen among the indicators. Thus, any fluctuation in the latent variable should immediately lead to similar changes in the indicators.These assumptions are presented in @fig-dag-latent-1.

\draw [-latex, draw=black] (eta) to (X2);
\draw [-latex, draw=black] (eta) to (Xn);

\end{tikzpicture}
```

### The Formative Model (Factor Analysis)

In a formative measurement model, the observed variables are seen as causing or determining the latent variable. Here again, there is a single latent variable. However this latent variable is taken to be an effect of the underlying indicators. These relations are presented in @fig-dag-latent-formative_0.

The formative model may be expressed:

$$\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon$$

In this equation, $\eta$ is the latent variable, $\lambda_i$ is the weight for $X_i$ (the observed variable), and $\varepsilon$ is the error term. The latent variable $\eta$ is a composite of the observed variables $X_i$.

In the context of a formative model, correlation or interchangeability between indicators is not required. Each indicator contributes distinctively to the latent variable. As such, a modification in one indicator doesn't automatically imply a corresponding change in the other indicators.

## Structural Interpretation of the formative model and reflective models (Factor Analysis)

VanderWeele has recently raised a host of problems arising for formative and reflective models that become clear when we examine their causal assuptions [@vanderweele2022].

> However, this analysis of reflective and formative models assumed that the latent η was causally efficacious. This may not be the case (VanderWeele 2022)

VanderWeele distinguishes between statistical and structural interpretations of the equations preesented above.

1.  **Statistical Model:** a mathematical construct that shows how observable variables, also known as indicators, are related to latent or unseen variables. These are presented in the equations above

2.  **Structural Model:** A structural model refers to the causal assumptions or hypotheses about the relationships among variables in a statistical model. The assumptions of the factor analytic tradition are presented in @fig-dag-latent-formative_0 and @fig-dag-latent-1 are structural models.

We have seen that the **reflective model** statistically implies that the observed variables (indicators) are reflections or manifestations of the latent variable, expressed as $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$. However, the factor analytic tradition makes the additional structural assumption that a univariate latent variable is causally efficacious and influences the observed variables, as in: @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model.

We have also seen that the **formative model** statistically implies that the latent variable is formed or influenced by the observed variables, expressed as $\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon$. However, the factor analytic tradition makes the additional assumption that the observed variables give rise to a univariate latent variable, as in @fig-dag-reflective-assumptions_note.

The reflective model implies $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$, which factor analysts take to imply @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model.

The formative model implies $\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon$, which factor analysts take to imply @fig-dag-reflective-assumptions_note.

## Problems with the structural interpretations of the reflective and formative factor models.

While the statistical model $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$ aligns with @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model, it also alings with @fig-dag-formative-assumptions-compatible. Cross-sectional data, unfortunately, do not provide enough information to discern between these different structural interpretations.

Similarly, the statistical model $\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon$ agrees with @fig-dag-reflective-assumptions_note but it also agrees with @fig-dag-reflectiveassumptions-compatible_again. Here too, cross-sectional data cannot decide between these two potential structural interpretations.

There are other, compatible structural interprestations as well. The formative and reflective conceptions of factor analysis are compatible with indicators having causal effects as shown in @fig_dag_multivariate_reality_again. They are also compatible with a multivariate reality giving rise to multiple indicators as shown in @fig-dag-multivariate-reality-bulbulia.

VanderWeele's key observation is this:

**While cross-sectional data can provide insights into the relationships between variables, they cannot conclusively determine the causal direction of these relationships.**

This results is worrying. The structural assumptions of factor analysis underpin nearly all psychological research. If the cross-sectional data used to derive factor structures cannot decide whether the structural interpretations of factor models are accurate, where does that leave us?

More worrying still, VanderWeele discusses several longitudinal tests for structural interpretations of univariate latent variables that do not pass.

Where does that leave us? In psychology we have heard about a replication crisis. We might describe the reliance on factor models as an aspect of a much larger, and more worrying "causal crisis"

## VanderWeele's model of reality

VanderWeele's article concludes as follows:

> A preliminary outline of a more adequate approach to the construction and use of psychosocial measures might thus be summarized by the following propositions, that I have argued for in this article: (1) Traditional univariate reflective and formative models do not adequately capture the relations between the underlying causally relevant phenomena and our indicators and measures. (2) The causally relevant constituents of reality related to our constructs are almost always multidimensional, giving rise both to our indicators from which we construct measures, and also to our language and concepts, from which we can more precisely define constructs. (3) In measure construction, we ought to always specify a definition of the underlying construct, from which items are derived, and by which analytic relations of the items to the definition are made clear. (4) The presumption of a structural univariate reflective model impairs measure construction, evaluation, and use. (5) If a structural interpretation of a univariate reflective factor model is being proposed this should be formally tested, not presumed; factor analysis is not sufficient for assessing the relevant evidence. (6) Even when the causally relevant constituents of reality are multidimensional, and a univariate measure is used, we can still interpret associations with outcomes using theory for multiple versions of treatment, though the interpretation is obscured when we do not have a clear sense of what the causally relevant constituents are. (7) When data permit, examining associations item-by-item, or with conceptually related item sets, may give insight into the various facets of the construct.

> A new integrated theory of measurement for psychosocial constructs is needed in light of these points -- one that better respects the relations between our constructs, items, indicators, measures, and the underlying causally relevant phenomena. (VanderWeele 2022)

This seems to me sensible. However, @fig-dag-multivariate-reality-complete this is not a causal graph. The arrows to not clearly represent causal relations. It leaves me unclear about what to practically do. My thoughts on measurement presented in the main article offer my best attempt to think of psychometric theory in light of causal inference.
