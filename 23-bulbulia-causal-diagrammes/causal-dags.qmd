## Abstract

## Introduction

Correlation is not causation. However, across many human sciences, persistent confusion in the analysis and reporting of correlations has limited scientific progress. The direction of causation frequently runs in the opposite direction to the direction of manifest correlations. This problem is widely known. Nevertheless, many human scientists report manifest correlations using hedging language. Making matters worse, widely adopted strategies for confounding control fail [@mcelreath2020], suggesting a "causality crisis" [@bulbulia2022]. Addressing the causality crisis is arguably among the human science's most pressing tasks.

When integrated into methodologically rigorous workflows, causal directed acyclic graphs ("DAGs", or "causal diagramms") can be powerful tools for clarifying causality.[^1] A system of formal mathematical proofs underpins their design. This brings confidence. No formal mathematical training is required to use them. This makes them accessible. However, causal inference relies on assumptions. causal diagrams are methods for encoding such assumptions. When assumptions are unwarrented, causal diagrams may decieve. For example, when researchers lack time-series data unbiased causal effect estimates are generally not warrented [@vanderweele2015]. Cross-sectional researchers who use causal diagrams to report their unrealistic assumptions use DAGS as props for unwarrented cover. Ideally causal diagrams would be equipped with safety mechanisms that prevent such misapplications.

[^1]: The term "DAG" is unfortunate because not all directed acyclic graphs are causal. For a graph to be causal it must satisfy the conditions of markov factorisation (see Appendix A).

Here, I present a set of strategies for writing causal diagrams (or causal diagrams as I will call them) that reduces the scope for unwarrented use. I call these *chronologically causal graph*, and offer a tutorial for cultural evolutionary researchers on their use.

There are many excellent introductions to causal diagrams [@rohrer2018; @hernan2023; @cinelli2022; @barrett2021; @mcelreath2020; @greenland1999; @suzuki2020; @pearl2009].[^2]. One may reasonably ask whether another introduction adds clutter. The approach I present here adds value in five ways.

[^2]: One of the best resources is Miguel Hernan's free course, here: <https://pll.harvard.edu/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-your-conclusions>.

In **Part 1.** , I explain how to effectively leverage causal diagrams within the framework of counterfactual or "potential" outcomes, an approach crucial for conceptualizing causality. In my view, a significant impediment to causal inference is the common misconception that it is purely an aspect of manifest data science. Instead, it should be considered an aspect of what migth be called counterfactual data science, an approach that formulates and answers quantitative comparative questions about how the world could have been different from its current state. Without the ability to ask and resolve such counterfactual questions, we cannot quantitatively evaluate causal claims. I devote attention to clarifying the counterfactual underpinnings of quantitative causal inference because one should not use causal diagrams without understanding that basis.

In **Part 2**, I review the four elemental forms of confounding. Here I show how chronological causal diagrams elucidate strategies for confounding control. A brief introduction examines

Although this discussion replicates material from other tutorials, by emphasising the benefits of temporal order in spatial organisation of a causal graph the conditions in which we may (or may not) identify causality in the presence of confounding become more apparent. Here, I briefly show how causal diagrams may clarify poorly understood concepts of interaction, mediation, and repeated measures longitudinal data. Chronologically consciencious causal diagrams help us to understand why commonplace modelling approaches such as multilevel modelling and structural equation modelling are often poorly suited to the demands of counterfactual data-science.

In **Part 3**, I explain how chronological causal diagrams clarify mission-critical demands for data-collection in three-wave panel designs.

In **Part 4**, I focus on the problem of selection bias as it arises in a three-wave panel, using chronological causal diagrams to focus attention on the imperatives for (a) adequate sampling and (b) longitudinal retention.

In **Part 5**, I focus on the problem of measurement error as it arises in a three-wave panel, again using chronological causal diagrams to focus attention on the imperatives for (a) ensuring reliable measures, (b) assessing pathways for confounding from correlated and directed measurement errors.

Additional technical details are presented in Appendices.

## Part 1. The three fundamental identifiability assumption for counterfactual data science

causal diagrams are powerful tools for answering causal questions. However before we can answer a causal question we must first understand how to ask one. In this section I review key concepts and identification assumptions.

### The fundamental problem of causal inference

We say that $A$ causes $Y$ if changing $A$ would have made a difference to the outcome of $Y$. The use of the subjective "would have" reveals the need for counterfactual reasoning to conceive of causal effects. To infer a causality requires a contrast between how the world as it is and how the world might have been. "Causal inference" we aim to quantify the magnitude of differences between the world as it is, and the world as it might have been.

Suppose there are manifest correlations in the data between cultural beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity. Suppose further that we are interested in estimating the causal effect of belief in Big Gods on social complexity. We call beliefs in Big Gods the "exposure" or "treatment." We denote the exposure using the symbol $A$. We call social complexity the outcome, denoted by the symbol $Y$. For now, we assume the exposure, outcome, and the units (cultures) are well-defined. Later we shall relax these assumptions.

To assess causality we must define two counterfactual (or "potential") outcomes for each culture in a population of cultures:

-   $Y_i(a = 1)$: The social complexity of culture $i$ if they believed in Big Gods. This is the outcome when $A_i = 1$. This outcoome is counterfactual for culture$_i$, when the exposure $A_i = 0$.
-   $Y_i(a = 0)$: The social complexity of culture $i$ if they did not believe in Big Gods. This is the counterfactual outcome when $A_i = 0$. This outcoome is counterfactual for culture$_i$ when the exposure $A_i = 1$.

The causal effect of a belief in Big Gods on social complexity for culture$_i$ may be defined as a contrast on the difference scale between two potential outcomes ($Y_i(a)$) under the two different levels of the exposure ($A_i = 1$ (belief in Big Gods); $A_i = 0$ (no belief in Big Gods)). For simplicity we assume these exposures are exhaustive. Under these assumptions:

$$
\text{Causal Effect of Belief in Big Gods}_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) 
$$

Notice that to assess causality we require a contrast between two states of the world only one of which any culture might actually realise [^3] That is, when a culture receives one level of a belief in Big Gods the outcome under the other level(s) is ruled out. That the manifest data present only partial evidence for quantifying causal contrasts is called "the fundamental problem of causal inference"[@rubin1976; @holland1986]. Inferring counterfactual contrasts is a special case of a *a missing data problem* [@westreich2015; @edwards2015].

[^3]: The counterfactual outcome under the exposure $A = a$ may be written in different ways, such as $Y(a)$ (the notation we use here), $Y^{a}$, and $Y_a$.

#### Simulating average causal effects under different exposures and contrasting them requires a counterfactual data-science.

Although we cannot generally observe unit-level causal effects, it may be possible to estimate average causal effects. We do this by contrasting the average effect in the population *were all units in exposed group* with the average effect in the unexposed group *were all units unexposed* group. Suppose we are interested in estimating this contrast on the difference scale. We may write this as the difference of the (1) average outcome were everyone exposed to one level of the intervention and (2) average outcome were everyone exposed to one level of the intervention, or equivalently as the average of the differences.[^4]

[^4]: Note that mathematically, the difference in the average expectation is equivalent to the average of the differences in expectation.

```{=tex}
\begin{alignat*}{2}
ATE & = E[(a)) - E(Y(0)]\\
& = E[Y(1) - Y(0)]
\end{alignat*}
```
The average treatment effects that we are interested in estimating need not be the effects of binary exposures. We may obtain contrasts between two different levels of a multinomial or continuous exposure. If we define the levels we wish to contrast as $A = a$ and $A = a*$. Then the average treatment effect is given by the expression:

```{=tex}
   \begin{align*}
    ATE = E[Y(a) - Y(a*)]
    \end{align*}
```
Recall that generally any unit-level causal effect is not identified in the data -- we only observe each unit under one or another exposure level. However, if the following three fundamental identification assumptions are credible, we may -- by assumption -- obtain these average (or "marginal" contrasts).

The three fundamental identification conditions for causal inference, when they obtain, allow researchers to recover the counterfactual contrasts necessary to compute causal effects from observed data. Not only does causal estimation rely on assumptions about the causal relationships that researchers hope to estimate, the data are generally insufficient to fully assess the fundamental identifibility assumptions on which causal estimation relies. Note that these assumptions are implicit in randomised experimental designs.

#### Identification assumption 1: causal consistency

We satisfy the causal consistency assumption when the potential or counterfactual outcome under exposure $Y(A=a)$ corresponds to the observed outcome $Y^{observed}|A=a$.

<!-- The standard expression for counterfactual recovery (e.g. @morgan2014) is given:  -->

<!-- $$Y^{observed} = AY(a=1) + (1-A)Y(a=0)$$ -->

<!-- Where the assumption of causal consistency is tenable, we may obtain the missing counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical exposures as observed outcomes under realised exposures, such that: -->

Where the assumption of causal consistency is tenable, we say that the missing counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical exposures are equal to the observed outcomes under realised exposures. That is, by substituting $Y_{observed}|A$ for $Y(a)$ we may recover counterfactual outcomes required for our causal contrasts from realised outcomes under different levels of exposures. Notice that the causal consistency assumption reveals the priority of counterfactual outcomes over actual outcomes. It is the causal consistency assumption that allows us to obtain counterfactual outcomes from data (including experimetnal data).

We obtain the counterfactual outcomes by setting the observed outcomes to the counterfactual outcomes:

$$
Y^{observed}_i = 
\begin{cases} 
Y_i(~a^*) & \text{if } A_i = a* \\
Y_i(~a~) & \text{if } A_i = a
\end{cases}
$$

Under which conditions may we set the observed outcomes of an exposure to the counterfactual outcomes under that exposure?

First, we must assume no interference, such that for any units $i$ and $j$, $i \neq j$, that receive treatment assignments $a_i$ and $a_j$, the potential outcome for unit $i$ under treatment $a_i$ is not affected by the treatment assignment to unit $j$, thus:

$$Y_i(a_i, a_j) = Y_i(a_i, a'_j)$$

for all $a_j, a'_j$.

Put differently, causal consistency requires that the potential outcome for unit $i$ when it receives treatment $a_i$ and unit $j$ receives treatment $a_j$ is the same as the potential outcome for unit $i$ when it receives treatment $a_i$ and unit $j$ receives any other treatment $a'_j$. Thus, the treatment assignment to any other unit $j$ does not affect the potential outcome of unit $i$. Where there are dependencies in the data, such as in social networks, where potential outcomes differ depending on the treatment assignments of others causal consistency will typically be violated.

We might assume that in any study, and especially in observational studies, there are differences between versions of treatment $A$ that individuals receive. Given such differences, how might we ever substitute observed treatments with counterfactual treatments?

A more general formulation of the no-interference assumption is the assumption of "treatment variation irrelevance" [@vanderweele2009], which has been developed into the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment. According to this theory, where there are $K$ versions of treatment $A$, if each element of $K$ is sufficiently well-defined to correspond to well-defined outcome $Y(k)$, and if there is no confounding for the effect of $K$ on $Y$ given measured confounders $L$, then we may use $A$ to as a coarsened indicator to consistently estimate the causal effect of the multiple versions of treatment $K$ on $Y(k)$. We write $Y(k)$ is independent of $K$ conditional on $L$ [@vanderweele2009; @vanderweele2013; @vanderweele2018] as:

$$K \coprod Y(k) | L$$ or equivalently

$$Y(k) \coprod K | L$$

Given this independence, $A$ denotes a function over multiple interventions: $A = f(k_1\dots K)$ and we may obtain causally consistent estimates for $A$. The prome

Unfortunately, where interventions (the cultural vectors of belief) are not clearly defined, we cannot accurately assess the conditional independence assumption. Moreover, even if we may assume conditional independence holds for all versions of cultural belief, we might struggle to understand the causal effect we have estimated. For instance, consider the impact of belief in Big Gods within a culture at a specific time on subsequent social complexity, noting that there are potentially many mechanisms through which a culture adopts these beliefs, including through shared history, collective experiences, the evolution of religious institutions, charismatic leaders, and societal transformations. To estimate "the causal effect of belief in Big Gods within a culture" without specifying the mechanism through which the belief is adopted, leaves us uncertain about which effects we are consistently estimating, much less whether these effects can be generalized to cultures where the distribution of $k \in K$ belief adoption mechanisms differs. For example, if the distribution of beliefs arising from charismatic leadership exceeds that of the adoption of ritual systems, we might erroneously infer that belief in Big Gods in a culture invariably leads to social complexity. Given the variability in measured observational data, those studying cultures must appreciate the limitations of validating and interpreting their results. (We will return to this mission critical realisation in Part 2.).

Finally, again note that although causal consistency assumption allows us to link observed outcomes with counterfactual outcomes, half of the observations that we require to obtain causal contrasts remain missing. Consider an experiment in which assignment to a binary treatment $A = {0,1}$ is random. We observe the realised outcomes $Y^{observed}|A = 1$ and $Y^{observed}|A = 0$, By causal consistency, $(Y^{observed}|A = 1) = Y(1)$ and $(Y^{observed}|A = 0) = Y(0)$. Nevertheless, the counterfactual outcomes for the treatments that the units did not receive are missing.

$$
ATE = \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1)|A = 1]}_\text{observed} + \underbrace{E[Y(1)|A = 0]}_\text{unobserved}\bigg) - \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(0)|A = 0]}_\text{observed}  + \underbrace{E[Y(0)|A = 1]}_\text{unobserved}\bigg)
$$ 

We next turn to the exchangeability assumption, which, when satisfied, allows us to impute those missing counterfactuals required for estimating causal effects, when the consistency assumption is satisified, that is, when the observed outcomes under a condition are assumed to correspond to their counterfactual outcomes. 

We will next consider how the exchangability assumption allows us to recover the missing counterfactual outcomes.

#### Identification assumption 2: exchangability

When we assume exchangability, we assume that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, given a set of observed covariates. Or equivalently, when we assume exchangability conditional on observed covariates, we assume the treatment assignment mechanism does not depend on the unobserved potential outcomes. This condition is one of "exchangeability" because conceptually, were we to "exchange" or "swap" individual units between the exposure and contrast conditions the distribution of potential outcomes would remain the same. Put differently, we say there is balance between the treatment conditions in the confounders that might affect the outcome. Where $L$ is a measured covariate, exchangability may be expressed:

$$Y(a)\coprod  A|L$$

or equivalently:

$$A \coprod  Y(a)|L$$

Where such exchangability conditional on measured covariates holds, then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
ATE = E[Y(a*)|L = l] - E[Y(a)|L = l] 
\end{aligned}
$$

Although causal diagrams or DAGs may be used to assess causal consistency assumption [@hernan2023b] and positivity assumption (no deterministic arrows in the DAG), their primary use is to clarify the conditions under which we may consistently estimate causal effects by conditioning on, or omitting, covariates to ensure conditional exchangeability.[^note_proviso]

[^note_proviso]: In section 4 and section 5 we will extend cuasal diagrams to consider selection and measurement bias "off the null", in conditions where there is an association between $A$ and $Y$, but it is distorted. 

#### Identification assumption 3: positivity

The positivity assumption is satisfied if there is a positive probability of receiving the exposure or non-receiving the exposure within every level of the the covariates. The probability of receiving every value of the exposure within all strata of co-variates is greater than zero is expressed:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
0 < \Pr(A=a|L)<1, ~ \forall a \in A, ~ \forall a \in L
\end{equation}
```
This assumption is crucial for causal inference because we cannot conceive of causal contrasts in the absence of the possibility for interventions (see: [@westreich2010]). There are two types of positivity violations:

-   **Random non-positivity**: the casual effect of ageing with observations missing within our data, but may be assumed to exist. For example every continuous exposure will lack (infinitely many) realisations on the number line, yet we may nevertheless use statistical models to estimate causal contrasts. This assumption is the only identifiability assumption that can be verified by data. Although our task here is not to guide researchers on how to model their data, we note that it is important for applied researchers to verify and report whether random non-positivity is violated in their data.

-   **Deterministic non-positivity**: the causal effect is inconceivable. For example, the causal effect of hysterectomy in biological males violates deterministic non-positivity.

### The difficulty of satisfying causal consistency and positivity assumptions when considering historical dynamics.

Our ability to derive meaningful causal contrasts from the data hinges on meeting three fundamental identification assumptions: causal consistency, exchangeability, and positivity. Given the inherently complex and multifaceted nature of history, it is a formidable a challenge to satisfy these prerequisites.

Consider the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther's reformation in the 16th century led to the establishment of Protestantism. Many have argued that Protestantism caused social, cultural, and economic changes in those societies where it took hold (see: [@weber1905 @weber1993; @swanson1967; @swanson1971; @basten2013], for an overview see: [@becker2016]). Suppose we are interested in estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the Reformation.We denote the adoption of Protestantism by $A = a*$. We want to compare the effect of such adoption with remaining Catholic, ($A = a$). For the purposes of this example, we assume that economic development is well-defined. Say we define the outcome in units of GDP +1 century after a country becomes predominantly Prosetant (compared with remaining Catholic), $Y_i(a^*) - Y_i(a)$. For any country this effect is not identified, but if we can satisfy the fundamental assumptions we can estimate $\frac{1}{n} \sum_i^{n} Y_i(a*) - Y_i(a)$ and

$$ATE_{\textnormal{economic~development}} = E[Y(\textnormal{Became~Protestant}) - Y(\textnormal{Remained~Catholic})]$$

Consider the two of the three fundamental identification assumptions.

**Causal Consistency**: The Reformation happened in different ways and to varying degrees across European societies. We must assume that the Protestant "treatment" ($a*$ or $a$) is well-defined and consistent across these differences circumstances. Yet consider how variable these "treatments" were in the case of Reformation Europe. In England, for example, the establishment of Protestantism was closely tied to the royal crown. King Henry VIII instigated the English Reformation primarily to establish himself as the head of the Church of England, separate from the papal authority of the Catholic Church.

<!-- This shift had profound economic implications, notably the dissolution of monasteries, which transferred enormous wealth from the Church to the Crown and to secular landowners. The redistribution of these resources, along with the expansion of the English naval power, led to significant economic growth and the establishment of the early British Empire. -->

The birthplace of the Protestant Reformation was Germany. Here, Martin Luther's teachings emphasised individual faith and the interpretation of scriptures. Historians argue that this emphasis led to educational fervour, which, in turn, supported increases literacy rates, even among the lower classes. This emphasis on education is believed to have sparked economic development by creating a more skilled and literate workforce. There is certainly ample scope for variation in the "Protestant exposure." Even if the theory of causal inference under multiple versions may be applied, it is unclear what we mean by "the causal effect of Protestantism."

<!-- However, the Protestant Reformation also led to a series of religious wars in Germany that had devastating effects on its population and economy, perhaps tempering the economic benefits of increased education. -->

Not only is there ample scope for heterogeneity in the "Protestant exposure", there is also ample scope for interference. Or more accurately, interference would appear to be a concerning aspect of such heterogeneity: societies in the 16th century were not isolated; they were rather intertwined through complex networks of trade, diplomacy, and warfare. These networks were variously affected by religious alliances. The religious choices of one society were not independent of the economic development of others [^5]. Here too the consistency assumption would appear to fail.

[^5]: For example, consider the relationship between Spain and the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th centuries. Protestantism in the Netherlands sowed the seeds for its Eighty Years' War against Catholic Spain. This war drained Spain's wealth and led to economic decline, while the Netherlands, benefiting from the innovation and economic liberties that accompanied their version of Protestantism, became one of the most prosperous nations in Europe. Treatment effects are not clearly independent of each other.

**Positivity**: The positivity assumption requires that every unit at ever level of the measured confounders has a non-zero probability of receiving both treatment. The units in our example are European cultures that may adopt Protestantism or remain Catholic within some bounded period of time. However, historical context arguably creates deterministic patterns that challenge this assumption.\[\^target\] However it is not clear that Spain could have been randomly assigned to Protestantism, compromising estimation of for an Average Treatment Effect. It would seem here that estimating the average treatement effect in the treated make more conceptual sense:

$$ATT = E[(Y(a*)- Y(a))|A = a*,L]$$

Here, the ATT is the expected difference in economic success in the cultures that became Protestant contrasted with their expected economic success had those cultures not become Protestant, conditional on measured confounders $L$, among the exposed ($A = a^*$) . However, to estimate this causal contrast we would need to match Protestant cultures with comparable non-protestant cultures. It would be for historians and philosophers to consider whether matching is conceptually plausible.[^6]

[^6]: There are deeper questions about whether we can conceptualise cultures as random realisations of a draw from possible cultures, which we will not consider here.

<!-- Notice also that the specification of our causal question is vague. Miguel Hernán argues that to ask a causal question requires specifying an hypothetical randomised experiment, which, although perhaps implausible, clarifies the precise causal contrast in which we are interested. On how to state a causal question in reference to a target trial see:[@bulbulia2022]. We are setting this problem aside to focus on problems of evaluating the three fundamental identification assumptions.  -->

Setting to the side fundamental conceptual questions about the coherence of randomising cultures to treatment assignments, it should be apparent there are considerable difficulties in meeting the assumptions required for addressing the causal consistency and positivity assumptions.

Suppose we manage to satisfy ourself of these assumptions. Suppose there are no further conceptual questions about the measurement of variables that may induce an association between the exposure and the outcomes. We are then ready to employ causal diagrams to assess the exchangebility assumption of no unmeasured confounding.

<!-- **Exchangeability** Let us assume that potential confounders may be balanced in the two conditions. For instance, political stability, which includes factors such as the consistency of leadership, social order, and the rule of law, can have profound effects both on a society's receptiveness to religious change and its economic development.  It is a confounder. How shall we operationalise it? Political stability in England under Henry VIII arguably differed both qualitatively and quantitatively with the stability of Sweden and Spain. It is unclear whether cultures could be considered exchangeable by such different measure of political stability. This is not to claim that we can never balance culture using measured covariates such as political stability, but only to underscore the conceptual challenges in doing so. These challenges arise in data rich settings, a point we will consider in *Part 4*. -->

<!-- During the Protestant Reformation, regional and geopolitical factors often played a large role in whether a society adopted Protestantism or remained Catholic, resulting in patterns that, on the face of it, constrain possibilities for religious change. We observe that many Northern European societies such as those in Scandinavia, parts of Germany, and England, were more inclined to adopt Protestantism. In contrast, Southern European societies like Italy, Spain, and Portugal remained predominantly Catholic. Why? -->

<!-- Consider Scandinavia, where Protestantism was widely adopted. The shift from Catholicism to Protestantism in this region was driven largely by the monarchies, which adopted Lutheran teachings almost uniformly. In Sweden, for instance, King Gustav Vasa championed the Reformation, in part to decrease the influence of the Catholic Church and consolidate his own power. As a result, Protestantism was adopted throughout his kingdom, virtually ensuring that everyone in Sweden was exposed to Protestantism. In this seeting, it is unclear how we could randomly assign Catholicism to Sweden. Doing so would appear to violate the positivity assumption. By contrast, consider Spain, where staunch support of Catholicism by the Spanish monarchy and the central role of the Inquisition in enforcing Catholic orthodoxy would appear to have constrained the adoption of Protestantism. Again, it is unclear how we could randomly assign religion to these countries, much less think of the assigments as clearly defined interventions. From the historical record, it does not appear credible to assume that Protestantism was possible for Spain any more than we can assume hystorectimes are possible for men. -->

<!-- 1. **Causal Consistency**: The causal consistency assumption might be violated if the 'treatment' (religious exposure) is not consistently defined. For instance, consider two individuals who identify as Christians. While both are exposed to Christianity, the 'version' of Christianity they practice could vary based on factors like denomination (e.g., Catholic, Protestant), personal beliefs, and local cultural practices. If these versions of the treatment have different effects on the outcome of interest (say, moral attitudes), then the causal consistency assumption is violated because the treatment (religious exposure) is not consistently defined across individuals. -->

<!-- 2. **Exchangeability**: The exchangability assumption might be violated if there are unmeasured confounders that affect both the treatment and the outcome. For example, consider the effect of religion (Christianity vs. Islam) on a particular outcome such as charitable giving. There could be unmeasured confounders like community influence or family traditions that influence both the religion one practices and the propensity to give to charity. If these confounders are not measured and controlled for, the exchangability assumption is violated, and the observed association between religion and charitable giving may not represent a causal association. -->

<!-- 3. **Positivity**: The positivity assumption might is violated if there are deterministic 'treatments' due to historical and geographical context. For example, someone born in a predominantly Muslim country like Saudi Arabia will almost certainly grow up practicing Islam, a deterministic 'treatment' that violates the positivity assumption. Similarly, someone born in Vatican City, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, will almost certainly grow up practicing Catholicism. In these cases, the historical and geographical context leads to near-absolute probabilities of certain religious exposures, violating the positivity assumption. -->

<!-- In all these cases, the historical and geographical context, which heavily influences cultural traits such as religion, can lead to violations of the causal consistency, exchangability, and positivity assumptions. Just as history can constrain cultural evolution and lead to violations of these assumptions, it can also lead to violations of other key assumptions in causal inference. -->

<!-- In cultural evolution, the scope for violation of deterministic non-positivity would appear to be rather wide, because the constraints are history are arguably rather strong. For example, the language one speaks, a cultural trait, is heavily influenced by one's historical and geographical context. For example, someone born in rural Japan will almost certainly grow up speaking Japanese, a deterministic 'treatment' that violates the positivity assumption. History places substantial constraints on cultural evolution, often leading to near-absolute probabilities of certain cultural exposures such as language, arising from one's place and history. This arguably leads to widespread violations of deterministic non-positivity for many questions cultural evolution. -->

<!-- bias when estimating contrasts between counterfactual outcomes from observational data. -->

<!-- The data that we observe only give us insight into the counterfactual outcomes to be contrasted under the identifying assumptions of causal consistency, exchangeability, and positivity. When we ask a causal question we are must state our exposure question, outcome(s), and the variables that lead to an association between them, and these variables must correspond to well-defined features in our data. We cannot generally test the assumptions of "no-unmeasured confounding," and so must take every effort to examine unmeasured sources of bias. Only after we have stated our causal question may we use causal diagrams to assist in answering that question. -->

### Summary Part 1

Causal inference is a process that involves comparing two potential outcomes by manipulating an intervention. This necessitates posing a "what if?" question. For this inquiry to have meaning, it is crucial to clearly define both the intervention being imposed and the potential effects it could engender.

Following this, it is important to scrutinise the assumptions needed to derive this hypothetical quantity -- the causal contrast -- from the data. There are three essential assumptions in play: causal consistency (which posits that the variation of treatment is irrelevant), positivity (which asserts that the intervention is not deterministically confined within the strata being compared), and exchangeability (which necessitates that there be no unmeasured confounding variables). causal diagrams serve as a helpful tool for analysing these assumptions, with a special focus on assessing the assumption of exchangeability. To effectively utilize causal diagrams, it is important to recognise that causal inference hinges on accurately estimating counterfactual contrasts. This process calls for a judicious mix of well-founded assumptions, high-quality data, and appropriate methods for analysis.

## Part 2. Chronologically conscienscious causal diagrams

### Background: concepts and convetions

To use causal diagrams, we must understand several key concepts and conventions:

1.  **Nodes and edges**: Nodes represent variables or events in a causal system, while edges denote the relationships between these variables.

2.  **Directed and undirected edges**: Directed edges (arrows) represent a causal influence from one variable to another, while undirected edges suggest some association or correlation without clear causality.

3.  **Ancestors and descendants**: In the graph, a variable is an ancestor of another if it influences it either directly or indirectly. Conversely, a variable is a descendant of another if it is influenced by that variable.

4.  **Confounding variables**: In causal analysis, these are factors that affect both the exposure (cause) and the outcome (effect), potentially distorting the observed relationship between them. In a causal graph, confounding variables are depicted as common ancestors of both the cause and effect nodes.

5.  **Confounding control by the Modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion**: VanderWeele's Modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion (MDCC) clarifies how to control for confounding in practice. According to this criterion, confounders are distinct variables that, when properly adjusted for, can lessen or eradicate the distortion caused by confounding variables [@vanderweele2019a]. This criterion provides three critical directives:

    a.  Control for any variable that serves as a cause for the exposure, the outcome, or both.

    b.  If a proxy exists for an unmeasured variable that is a shared cause of both exposure and outcome, control for it.

    c.  Define "instrumental variable" to denote any variable that, although associated with the exposure, does not independently influence the outcome except through the exposure. Rule: any instrumental variable that is not proxy for an unmeasured confounder should be excluded from the confounder set. 

6.  **D-separation**: On a causal graph, paths show possible routes of influence between nodes. A path is blocked (or d-separated) if there is a node on it that blocks the transmission of influence. Two variables are said to be d-separated if every path between them is blocked, otherwise they are said to be d-connected.

7.  **Compatibility**: If two variables are d-separated given a third, we say the two variables are independent conditional on the third.

8.  **(Weak) Faithfulness**: If two variables are d-connected given a third, we say the two variables are expected to be associated conditional on the third.

9.  **Markov factorisation**: relates graph structure to joint probability distributions of represented variables. Given a causal graph with nodes corresponding to variables $X = (X_1, ..., X_n)$, the joint distribution $P(X)$ factorises according to the graph if it is expressed as a product of conditional distributions for each node given its direct parents. In formula terms, $P(X) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | \text{pa}_G(X_i))$, where $\text{pa}_G(X_i)$ are the parent nodes of $X_i$ in graph $G$. This shows that each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants, given its parents.

10. **Back-door criterion**: This is a condition that, if satisfied, allows us to estimate causal effects from observational data. It relies on the concept of "d-separation" and demands that no back-door paths (paths that start from the outcome and head back to the cause) are left open.[^7]

[^7]: Note, there is also a Front-door Criterion, which allows another way to estimate causal effects, even in the presence of unmeasured confounding variables. It relies on identifying a variable (or set of variables) that mediates the entire effect of the treatment on the outcome (reference). To my knowledge, the front-door criterion is rarely used in practice.

10. **Identification problem**: refers to the challenge of estimating the causal effect of a variable using observed data, especially in the presence of confounding variables.

11. **Acyclic**: causal diagrams must be acyclic -- they must not contain feedback loops. More precisely, no variable may be an ancestor or descendent of itself. For this reason, in cases where there are repeated measurements, we must index nodes by time.  As mentioned throughout, we should nearly always require repeated measures time series data to quantitatively estimate causal effects. 

We will explain the application of these concepts below.

#### Variable naming conventions

**Outcome**: The outcome may be denoted by any symbol. Here we use $Y$. The outcome is the "effect." It should be distinctly defined in any causal diagram. For instance, instead of ambiguously stating "the causal effect of the Protestant Reformation on economic success," be specific, such as "the +100 year effect on adjusted GDP after a country transitioned to a Protestant majority." By doing so, you might reveal the limitations or challenges of causal inference, including conceptual incoherence, lack of relevance, or data deficiencies.

**Exposure or treatment**: The "exposure" or "treatment" may be denoted by any symbol. Here we use $A$. It's imperative that the exposure is clearly defined and doesn't violate deterministic non-positivity. A precise understanding of the intervention allows us to accurately assess how outcomes might vary had the intervention been different.

**Measured confounders**: The "exposure" or "treatment" may be denoted by any symbol. Here we use $L$. Confounders are variables that when adjusted for, minimize or remove the non-causal association between exposure $A$ and outcome $Y$. To simplify a causal graph, variables with similar functions are often grouped under a single symbol. For instance, if $\text{male} \to A, Y$ and $\text{age} \to A, Y$, we can say $\bf{L} \to A, Y$, where $\bf{L}$ is a set that includes the variables $\text{male}$ and $\text{age}$ ($\{\text{male, age}\}\in \bf{L}$).

**Unmeasured confounder** Unmeasured confounders may be denoted by any symbol. Here we will $U$. An unmeasured confounder is a variables that influence both exposure $A$ and outcome $Y$ but that is not measured or adjusted for in the analysis. This could potentially introduce bias in estimating the causal effect of $A$ on $Y$. In a causal graph, unmeasured confounders might be represented as $U \to A, Y$. This underlines the necessity for sensitivity analyses to estimate the influence of unmeasured confounders on your findings.

**Selection variables** Any variable may denote selection. In causal diagrams, selection is often represented with a box around the variable or a dashed circule. Here we use $\framebox{S}$

**Mediators** Any variable may denote a mediator. Here we use either $L$ or $M$, depending on the context. A mediator is variable that may be affected by the exposure and may subsequently affect the outcome. This can be represented as $A \to M \to Y$. Unless you are specifically interested in mediation, do not adjust for a mediator when estimating the total effect of $A$ on $Y$.

**Interactions** Interactions are considered when the combined effects of two variables $A$ and $B$ on the outcome $Y$ differ from their separate effects, or if the effect of $A$ on $Y$ varies across levels of $B$. These are typically represented as $A \to Y; B \to Y$. Note that causal diagrams do not represent non-linear effects; they are used to assess biases such that the statistical association between the exposure and outcome does not reflect the true causal association.

In the following section, we describe the core strength of causal diagrams: their ability to vividly demonstrate that controlling for confounding effectively necessitates blocking all 'back door' paths linking the exposure and the outcome, while avoiding conditioning a mediators.

## Elemental counfounds

There are four elemental confounds [@mcelreath2020 p.185]. Here we consider how chronological conscientiousness in the graph assists with tasks of confounding control.

### 1. The problem of confounding by common cause

The problem of confounding by common cause arises when there is a variable denoted by $L$ that influences both the exposure, denoted by $A$ and the outcome variable, denoted by $Y.$ Because $L$ is a common cause of $A$ and $Y$, $L$ may create a statistical association between $A$ and $Y$ that does not reflect a causality. For example, people who smoke may have yellow fingers. Smoking causes cancer. Because smoking ($L$) is a common cause of yellow fingers ($A$) and cancer ($Y$), $A$ and $Y$ will be associated. However, intervening to change the colour of people's fingers would not affect cancer. The dashed red arrow in the graph indicate bias arising from the open backdoor path from $A$ to $Y$ that results from the common cause $L$.

```

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of cauasality

Confounding by a common cause can be addressed by adjusting for it. Adjustment closes the backdoor path from the exposure to the outcome. Typically we adjust through through statistical models such as regression, matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and G-methods. (Again, it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to describe causal estimation techniques.) Figure @fig-dag-common-cause-solution clarifies that any confounding that is a cause of $A$ and $Y$ will precede $A$ (and so $Y$), because causes precede effects. By indexing the the nodes on the graph, we can readily understand that **confounding control typically requires time-series data.**

```

### 2. Confounding by collider stratification (conditioning on a common effect)

Conditioning on a common effect occurs when a variable $L$ is affected by both the treatment $A$ and an outcome $Y$.

Suppose $A$ and $Y$ are initially independent, such that $A \coprod Y(a)$. Conditioning on the common effect $L$ opens a backdoor path between $A$ and $Y$, potentially inducing an association. This occurs because $L$ can provide information about both $A$ and $Y$. Here is an example:

Let $A$ denote the level of belief in Big Gods (with higher values indicating stronger belief), $Y$ denote the level of social complexity, and $L$ denote the level of economic trade. Now, suppose that belief in Big Gods and social complexity are not causally linked. However, both of these factors influence the level of economic trade, and if we condition on economic trade in a cross-sectional study, we might find a statistical association between belief in Big Gods and social complexity even though there's no causal link.

If we denote the observed associations as follows:

-   $P(A)$: Distribution of beliefs in Big Gods
-   $P(Y)$: Distribution of social complexity
-   $P(L)$: Distribution of economic trade

Without conditioning on $L$, and if $A$ and $Y$ are independent, we have:

$$P(A, Y) = P(A)P(Y)$$

However, if we condition on $L$ (which is a common effect of both $A$ and $Y$), we have:

$$P(A, Y | L) \neq P(A | L)P(Y | L)$$

The common effect $L$, once conditioned on, creates an association between $A$ and $Y$ that is not causal. This can mislead us into believing there is a direct link between beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity, even in the absence of such a link. If we only observe $A$, $Y$, and $L$ and compute correlations, without time-series data measured on the units of analysis, we might erroneously conclude that there is a causal relationship between $A$ and $Y$. This is an example of collider-stratification bias, which occurs when we condition on a common effect (a 'collider') of two variables.[^8]

[^8]: When $A$ and $Y$ are independent, the joint probability of $A$ and $Y$ is equal to the product of their individual probabilities: $P(A, Y) = P(A)P(Y)$. However, when we condition on $L$, the joint probability of $A$ and $Y$ given $L$ is not necessarily equal to the product of the individual probabilities of $A$ and $Y$ given $L$, hence the inequality $P(A, Y | L) \neq P(A | L)P(Y | L)$.

Conditioning on a common effect is an example of "collider" bias.

```

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of cauasality, and show this in your causal graph

To address the problem of conditioning on a common effect, we should generally ensure that all confounders $L$ that are common causes of the exposure $A$ and the outcome $Y$ are measured before the occurence of the exposure $A$, and furthermore that the exposure $A$ is measured before the occurence of the outcome $Y$. If such temporal order is preserved, $L$ cannot be an effect of $A$, and thus neither of $Y$. By measuring all relevant confounders before the exposure, researchers can minimise the scope for collider confounding by conditioning on a common effect. This rule is not absolute.[^9]. In the case of the example just described, we would require time-series data with accurate measures in a sufficiently large sample of cultures prior to the introduction of certain religious beliefs, and the cultures would need to be independent of each other.[^10]

[^9]: However, as indicated in @fig-dag-descendent-solution, it may be useful in certain circumstances to condition on a confounder that occurs after the outcome has occurred.

[^10]: The independence of cultural units was at the centre of the study of comparative urban archeaology throughout from the late 19th [@decoulanges1903] and 20th century [@wheatley1971]. Despite attention to this problem in recent work (e.g. [@watts2016]), there is arguably greater "head-room" for understanding the need for conditional independence in recent cultural evolutionary studies.

### M-bias: conditioning on a collider that occurs before the exposure may introduce bias

Typically (with exceptions described below), indicators for confounders should included only if they are known to be measured before their exposures. However, researchers should be also cautious about over-conditioning on pre-exposure variables that are not associated with both the exposure and confounder, as doing so can induce confounding. As shown in @fig-m-bias, collider stratification may arise even if $L$ occurs before $A$. This happens when $L$ does not affect $A$ or $Y$, but may be the descendent of a unmeasured variable that affects $A$ and another unmeasured variable that also affects $Y$. Conditioning on $L$ in this scenario evokes what is called "M-bias." If $L$ is not a common cause of both $A$ and $Y$, or the effect of a shared common cause, $L$ should not be included in a causal model. @fig-m-bias presents a case in which $A \coprod Y(a)$ but $A \cancel{\coprod} Y(a)| L$. M-bias is another example of collider bias (see: [@cole2010])

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-m-bias

\draw [-latex, draw =black, bend right] (U2) to (A);
\draw [-latex,  draw=red, red, dashed] (A) to (Y);


\end{tikzpicture}
```

### Advice: adopt a modified disjunctive cause criterion for confounding control

Again, the modified disjunctive cause criterion will satisfy the backdoor criterion in all cases, and reduce bias where this criterion cannot be fully satisfied:

> Control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome, see @vanderweele2020 page 441 and [@vanderweele2019a]

Of course, the difficulty is in determining which variables belong to the desired set. This task can be facilitated by specialist knowledge but cannot generally be ascertained from the data.

### 3 The problem of conditioning on a mediator

Conditioning on a mediator occurs when $L$ lies on the causal pathway between the treatment $A$ and the outcome $Y$. Conditioning on $L$ can lead to biased estimates by blocking or distorting the total effect of $A$ and $Y$.

Let $A$ denote "beliefs in Big Gods", $Y$ denote "social complexity", and $L$ denote "economic trade". Suppose that "beliefs in Big Gods" directly influences "economic trade", and "economic trade" in turn influences "social complexity". Here, $L$ ("economic trade") acts as a mediator for the effect of $A$ ("beliefs in Big Gods") on $Y$ ("social complexity").

If we condition on $L$ ("economic trade"), we could potentially bias our estimates of the total effect of $A$ ("beliefs in Big Gods") on $Y$ ("social complexity"). This is because conditioning on $L$ will typically attenuate the direct effect of $A$ on $Y$ as it "blocks" the indirect path through $L$, as presented in @fig-dag-mediator.

In the example just considered we do not induce bias under the null. If $A$ were not associated with $Y$ then conditioning on $M$ would not open a backdoor path between $A$ and $L$. However, it is not generally the case that conditioning on a mediator will not induce bias under the null. As described below in @fig-dag-descendent, if $L$ is the common effect of the exposure $A$ and an unmeasured variable $U$ that is associated with the outcome $Y$, then including $L$ may increase the strength of association between $A$ and $Y$, even if $A$ is not associated with $Y$ and even if $U$ is not a cause of $A$.

Therefore, unless one is interested in mediation analysis, conditioning on a post-treatment variable is nearly always a bad idea (see @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2 for a counter example). Again attention to chronology in the graph has practical implications for data collection. If we cannot ensure that $L$ is measured before $A$ and if $A$ may affect $L$, including $L$ in our model risks mediator bias.

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of causality

To mitigate the issue of mediator bias, particularly when our focus is on total effects, we should avoid conditioning on a mediator. This can be achieved by ensuring that the mediator $L$ takes place before the treatment $A$ and the outcome $Y$. This underlines the importance of explicitly stating the temporal ordering of our variables. By including time indexing of all variables in our causal graph and by clearly labelling mediators (e.g. with $M_t$), we reduce the potential for mediator bias from over-conditioning.[^11]

[^11]: Note that if $L$ is associated with $Y$ and cannot be caused by $A$, conditioning on $L$ will often enhance the precision of the estimate for the causal effect of $A$ on $Y$. This holds true even if $L$ occurs after $A$. However, the onus is on us to explain that the post-treatment factor cannot be a consequence of the exposure. Moreover including $L$ is not, in this instance, required for confounding control. We consider post-treatment conditioning next.

### 4. Conditioning on a descendant

Say $L$ is a cause of $L^\prime$. According to Markov factorisation, if we condition on $L$ we partially condition on $L^\prime$.

There are both negative and positive implications for causal estimation in real-world scenarios.

First the negative. Suppose there is a confounder $L^\prime$ that is caused by an unobserved variable $U$, and is affected by the treatment $A$. Suppose further that $U$ causes the outcome $Y$. In this scenario, as described in @fig-dag-descendent, conditioning on $L^\prime$, which is a descendant of $A$ and $U$, can lead to a spurious association between $A$ and $Y$ through the path $A \to L^\prime \to U \to Y$.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-descendent
#| fig-cap: "Confounding by Descent: The red dashed arrow illustrates the introduction of bias due to the opening of a 'backdoor' path between the exposure (A) and the outcome (Y) when conditioning on a descendant of a confounder. This failure to maintain d-separation in the association between the exposure and the outcome leads to potential bias in the causal inference."

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of causality, and use expert knowledge of all relevant nodes.

Ensuring the confounder ($L^\prime$) is measured before the exposure ($A$) has two benefits.

First, if $L^\prime$ is a confounder, that is, if $L^\prime$ is a variable which if we fail to condition on it will bias the association between treatment and outcome, the strategy of including only pre-treatment indicators of $L\prime$ will reduce bias. @fig-dag-descendent-solution presents this strategy

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-descendent-solution
#| fig-cap: "Solution: again, ensure temporal ordering in all measured variables. A and Y remain d-separated."
#| out-width: 80%
#| echo: false

\node [rectangle, draw=white] (U) at (0, 0) {U};
\node [rectangle, draw=black] (L) at (2, 0) {$L^{\prime}_{t0}$};
\node [rectangle, draw=white](A) at (4, 0) {$A_{t1}$};
\node [ellipse, draw=white] (Y) at (6, 0) {$Y_{t2}$};

\draw [-latex, draw=black] (U) to (L);
\draw [-latex, draw=black] (L) to (A);
\draw [-latex, bend right=50, draw =black] (U) to (Y);


\end{tikzpicture}

```

Second, note that we may use descendent to reduce bias. For example, if an unmeasured confounder $U$ affects $A$, $Y$, and $L^\prime$, then adjusting for $L^\prime$ may help to reduce confounding caused by $U$. This scenario is presented in @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2, and clarifies why the the modified disjunctive cause criterion for confounding control advises that we "include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome" [@vanderweele2019a].

Note furthermore that in this graph, $L^\prime$ may occur *after* the exposure, and indeed occurs *after* the outcome. This shows that it would be wrong to infer that merely because causes precede effects, we should only condition on confounders that precede the exposure.

###  Case 1: causal Interaction: do not attempt to draw non-linear relationships such as interactions

Those studying causal diagramms often wonder how to depict interactions within these structures. This is a sensible question, especially because interactions can be scientifically important. However, it is crucial to remember the primary function of causal diagramms: to ensure d-separation (conditional independence) between exposure and outcome variables. Causal diagrams are not designed to capture all facets of a phenomenon under investigation. Furthermore, causal diagrams are qualitative tools and do not inherently represent non-parametric characteristics of reality, such as additive and multiplicative interaction.

Some misunderstandings can arise regarding the role and function of causal diagrams. These often stem from deeper confusions about the concept of interaction itself. Given this, it is worth taking a moment to clarify the notion of interaction within a counterfactual causal framework. Again, in much scientific research, evaluating evidence for interaction is oftent important. However, to accurately handle this concept, a crucial distinction must be made between causal interaction and effect modification.

#### **Causal interaction as two independent exposures: what to graph**

Causal interaction is the effect of two exposures that may occur jointly or separately (or not occur). We say there is interaction on the scale of interest when the effect of one exposure on an outcome depends on the level of another exposure. For example, the effect of a beliefs in Big Gods (exposure A) on social complexity (outcome Y) might depend on whether a culture has monumental architecture (exposure B), which in turn might also affect social complexity. Evidence for causal interaction on the difference scale would be present if:

$$\bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1,1)]}_{\text{joint exposure}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}}\bigg) - \bigg[ \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1,0)]}_{\text{only A exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}}\bigg) + \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(0,1)]}_{\text{only B exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}} \bigg)\bigg] \neq 0 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ \underbrace{E[Y(1,1)]}_{\text{joint exposure}} - \underbrace{E[Y(1,0)]}_{\text{only A exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,1)]}_{\text{only B exposed}} + \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}} \neq 0 $$

If these equations hold, the effect of exposure A on the outcome is not the same across different levels of exposure B, or vice versa, indicating there is an interaction between exposure A and exposure B.

If the quantity on the left hand side is greater than zero there is evidence for positive interaction; if it is less than zero there is evidence a sub-additive effect; if this quantity is indistinguishable from zero we say there is no evidence for interaction.[^12]

[^12]: Note that the causal effects of interactions often differ when measured on the ratio scale. This can have important policy implications, see: [@vanderweele2014]. Although beyond the scope of this article, when evaluating evidence for causality we must clarify the measure of effect in which we are interested[@hernán2004; @tripepi2007].

How do we represent interaction on a causal graph? Remember, causal diagrams are not parametric; they represent the qualitative aspects of causal relationships without making specific assumptions about the functional form of these relationships. We do not use causal diagrams to represent interactions. We use them to identify sources of confounding and strategies for confounding control. Although causal diagrams can indicate the presence of an interaction by showing two exposures jointly influencing an outcome, as in @fig-dag-interaction, they do not represent the nature or scale of the interaction directly.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-interaction
#| fig-cap: "Causal interaction: if two exposures are causally independent of each other, we may wish to estimate their individual and joint effects on Y, where the counterfactual outcome is Y(a,b) and there is evidence for additive or subadditive interaction if E[Y(1,1) - Y(0,1) - Y(1,0) + Y(0,0)] ≠ 0. If we cannot conceptualise B as a variable upon which there can be intervention, then the interaction is better conceived as effect modification (see next figure). Important: DAGs are not parametric so to express interaction do not draw a path into another path, or attempt other such shenanigans."

#### **Causal interaction considered as effect modification: what to graph**

When discussing evidence for effect modification, we're essentially looking at how the effect of a given exposure on an outcome varies according to different levels of another variable. For instance, consider a study where we're interested in how the influence of belief in Big Gods on social complexity might vary between early urban civilizations in China and South America. In this scenario, 'geography' (China versus South America) serves as the 'effect modifier.' That is, to investigate effect modification, we focus on how the influence of our exposure (belief in Big Gods) on the outcome (social complexity) differs across various levels of our effect modifier (geography). It is important to note that we are not considering the effect modifier as a variable on which we intervene, but merely one that might change the effect of our exposure on the outcome of interest.

To fill this out, suppose we are comparing two levels of exposure, which we'll call $A = a$ and $A= a^*$. Suppose further that $G$ has two levels, which we will call $g$ and $g'$. Then:

 $$\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g]$$ 

represents the expected outcome when the exposure is at level $A=a$ among individuals in group $G=g$.

$$\hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g]$$ 

represents the expected outcome when the exposure is at level $A=a^*$ among individuals in group $G=g$.

The difference 

$$\hat{\delta}_g = \hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g]$$ 

is our estimated causal effect of changing the exposure from $a^*$ to $a$ in group $g$.

Similarly, 
$$\hat{\delta}_{g'} = \hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g'] - \hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g']$$
is our estimated causal effect of changing the exposure from $a^*$ to $a$ in group $g'$.

Finally, we can compare the causal effects between these two groups by computing 

$$\hat{\gamma} = \hat{\delta}_g - \hat{\delta}_{g'}$$

This value, $\hat{\gamma}$, tells us how much the impact of changing the exposure from $a^*$ to $a$ varies between groups $g$ and $g'$. If $\hat{\gamma}\neq 0$ this implies that the exposure has a different effect in the two groups, indicating effect modification.

When representing effect modification, it is again important to remember that causal diagrams are not parametric. Thus to represent effect modification, do *not* draw a path intersecting another path or attempt another visualisation. Rather, simply draw two edges into to exposure @fig-dag-effect-modfication. Keep at the front of your mind that your purpose in drawing a causal graph is to assess confoundings and to addressing the identification problem. Here again, representing the temporal order of events in the spatial layout of your graph will make the identification problem clearer because causes must precede effects.(To understand finer-grained distinctions see: [@vanderweele2007].)

### Case 2: Causal mediation: causal graphs show the inadequacy of standard approaches

The conditions necessary for causal mediation are stringent. Chronologically arranged causal diagrams, as shown in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions, can aid us in identifying both the promise and perils of causal mediation. We will again keep to the question of whether cultural beliefs in Big Gods affect social complexity, and ask whether this affect is mediated by political authority.

1.  **No unmeasured exposure-outcome confounders given** $L$

This prerequisite is expressed as $Y(a,m) \coprod A | L1$. Upon controlling for the covariate set $L1$, we must ensure that there are no additional unmeasured confounders affecting both the cultural beliefs in Big Gods $A$ and the social complexity $Y$. For example, if our study involves the impact of cultural beliefs in Big Gods (exposure) on social complexity (outcome), and geographic location and historical context are our covariates $L1$, this assumption of no unmeasured confounding suggests that accounting for $L1$ sufficiently covers any subsequent correlation between $A$ and $Y$. The relevant confounding path is depicted in brown in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

2.  **No unmeasured mediator-outcome confounders given** $L$

This condition is expressed as $Y(a,m) \coprod M | L2$. Upon controlling for the covariate set $L2$, we must ensure that no other unmeasured confounders affect both the political authority $M$ and social complexity $Y$. For instance, if trade networks impact both political authority and social complexity, we must account for trade networks to obstruct the otherwise unblocked path linking our mediator and outcome. Further, we must assume the absence of any other confounders for the mediator-outcome path. This confounding path is represented in blue in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

3.  **No unmeasured exposure-mediator confounders given** $L$

This requirement is represented as $M(a) \coprod A | L3$. Upon controlling for the covariate set $L3$, we must ensure that there are no additional unmeasured confounders affecting both the cultural beliefs in Big Gods $A$ and political authority $M$. For example, the capability to construct large ritual theaters may influence both the belief in Big Gods and the level of political authority. If we have indicators for this technology measured prior to the emergence of Big Gods (these indicators being $L3$), we must assume that accounting for $L3$ is enough to obstruct the backdoor path between the exposure and the mediator for unbiased natural mediated effect estimation. This confounding path is shown in green in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

4.  **No mediator-outcome confounder affected by the exposure (no red arrow)**

This requirement is indicated as $Y(a,m) \coprod M^{a^*} | L$. We must ensure that no variables confounding the relationship between political authority and social complexity in $L2$ are themselves influenced by the cultural beliefs in Big Gods ($A$). For instance, when studying the effect of cultural beliefs in Big Gods ($A$, the exposure) on social complexity ($Y$, the outcome) mediated by political authority (mediator), this assumption means that there are no factors, such as trade networks ($L2$), that influence both political authority and social complexity and are affected by the belief in Big Gods. This confounding path is shown in red in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions. It is important to note that **the assumption of no mediator/outcome confounder affected by the exposure is challenging to satisfy**. If the exposure influences a confounder of the mediator and outcome, we face a dilemma. If we do not account for this confounder, the backdoor path between the mediator and outcome remains open. By accounting for it, however, we partially obstruct the path between the exposure and mediator, leading to bias. Consequently, the natural direct and indirect effects can't be identified from the manifest data, even with perfect measures of the relevant confounders. Notice again that the requirements for counterfactual data science are more strict than for descriptive or predictive data science. Nonetheless, we can set the mediator to certain levels and explore controlled direct and indirect effects, which may be relevant for science and policy. For instance, if we were to fix political authority at a specific level, we could ask, what would be the direct and indirect causal effects of Big Gods on Social Complexity? There are other approaches that involve sampling from the observed distributions to obtain probablistic identification (an excellent resource is [@shi2021] ). Answering such questions typically necessitates the use of G-methods, which the subsequent section will elaborate on. For now, we have seen how chronologically ordered causal diagrams elucidate the conditions necessary for mediation analysis in addressing causal questions.[^13]

[^13]: An excellent resource both for understanding causal interaction and causal mediation is [@vanderweele2015a].

The green edges denote the path for common causes of the exposure and mediator. To block this path we must condition on L3.  The blue edges denote the path for common causes of the mediator and outcome. To block this path we must condition on L2. The red path denotes the effect of the exposure on the confounder of the mediator and outcome. If any such path exists then we cannot obtain natural direct and indirect effects. Conditioning on L2 is necessary to prevent mediator outcome confounding but doing so blocks the effect of the exposure on the mediator."

### Case 3: Confounder-treatment feedback: causal graphs show the inadequacy of standard approaches

Causal mediation is a special case in which we have multiple sequential exposures. Here again chronologically organised causal diagrams can help us to understand the problems and opportunities for causal inference using time-series data.

For example, consider temporally fixed multiple exposures. The counterfactual outcomes may be denoted $Y(a_{t1} ,a_{t2})$. There are four counterfactual outcomes corresponding to the four fixed "treatment regimes":

1.  **Always treat (Y(1,1))**: This regime involves providing the treatment at every opportunity.

2.  **Never treat (Y(0,0))**: This regime involves abstaining from providing the treatment at any opportunity.

3.  **Treat once first (Y(1,0))**: This regime involves providing the treatment only at the first opportunity and not at subsequent one.

4.  **Treat once second (Y(0,1))**: This regime involves abstaining from providing the treatment at the first opportunity, but then providing it at the second one.

There are six causal contrasts that we might compute for the four fixed regimes, presented in @tbl-regimes [^14]

[^14]: We compute the number of possible combinations of contrasts by $C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!}$

| Type     | Description                            | Counterfactual Outcome |
|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Regime   | Always treat                           | Y(1,1)                 |
| Regime   | Never treat                            | Y(0,0)                 |
| Regime   | Treat once first                       | Y(1,0)                 |
| Regime   | Treat once second                      | Y(0,1)                 |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Never treat           | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(0,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Treat once first      | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(1,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Treat once second     | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(0,1)\]   |
| Contrast | Never treat vs. Treat once first       | E\[Y(0,0) - Y(1,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Never treat vs. Treat once second      | E\[Y(0,0) - Y(0,1)\]   |
| Contrast | Treat once first vs. Treat once second | E\[Y(1,0) - Y(0,1)\]   |

: Table describes four fixed treatment regimes and six causal contrasts in time series data where the exposure may vary. {tbl-regimes}

We might also consider treatment to be a function of the previous outcome. For example, we might **Treat once first** and then **treat again** or **do not treat again** depending on the outcome of the previous treatment. This is called "time-varying treatment regimes."

Note that to estimate the "effect" of a treatment regime, we must compare the counterfactual quantities of interest. The same conditions that apply for causal identification in mediation analysis apply to causal identification in multiple treatment settings. And notice, just as mediation opens the possibility of time-varying confounding (condition 4, in which the exposure effects the confounders of the mediator/outcome path), so too we find that with time-varying treatments comes the problem of time-varying confounding. Unlike traditional causal mediation analysis, the sequence of treatment regimes that we might consider is indefinitely long.

Temporally organised causal diagrams again help us to discover the problems with traditional multi-level regression analysis and structural equation modelling. Suppose we are interested in the question of whether beliefs in big Gods affect social complexity.

First consider fixed regimes. Suppose we have well-defined concept of social complexity and excellent measurements over time. Suppose we want to compare the effects of beliefs on big Gods on Social complexity using historical data measured over two centuries. Our question is whether the introduction and persistence of such beliefs differs from having no such beliefs. The treatment strategies are: "always believe in big Gods" versus "never believe in big Gods" on the level of social complexity. Consider @fig-dag-9. Here, $A_{tx}$ represents the cultural belief in "Big Gods" at time $tx$, and $Y_{tx}$ is the outcome, social complexity, at time $x$. Economic trade, denoted as $L_{tx}$, is a time-varying confounder because it varies over time and confounds the effect of $A$ on $Y$ at several time points $x$. To complete our causal diagramme we include an unmeasured confounder $U$, such as oral traditions, which might influence both the belief in big Gods and social complexity.

We know that the level of economic trade at time $0$, $L_{t0}$, influences the belief in "big Gods" at time $1$, $A_{t1}$. We therefore draw an arrow from $L_{t0}$ to $A_{t1}$. But we also know that the belief in "big Gods", $A_{t1}$, affects the future level of economic trade, $L_{t(2)}$. This means that we need to add an arrow from $A_{t1}$ to $L_{t2}$. This causal graph represents a feedback process between the time-varying exposure $A$ and the time-varying confounder $L$. This is the simplest graph with exposure-confounder feedback. In real world setting there would be more arrows. However, our DAG need only show the minimum number of arrows to exhibit the problem of exposure-confounder feedback. (We should not clutter our causal diagrams: only provide the essential details.)

What happens if we were to condition on the time-varying confounder $L_{t3}$? Two things would occur. First, we would block all the backdoor paths between the exposure $A_{t2}$ and the outcome. We need to block those paths to eliminate confounding. Therefore, conditioning on the time-varying confounding is essential. However, paths that were previously blocked would not be pen. For example, the path $A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{t(4)}$, which was previous closed is opened because the time varying confounder is the common effect of $A_{t1}$ and $U$. Conditioning opens the path $A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{3}$. Therefore we must avoid conditioning on the time varying confounder. We are damned-if-we-do-or-do-not condition on the confounder that is affected by the prior exposure.

As with mediation, however, is may be possible to identify controlled causal effects. Models for assessing such controlled causal effects of time-fixed and time-varying exposures belong to a class of methods called "G-methods" [@naimi2017; @chatton2020; @robins; @hernán2006] There has been rapid recent development in the applications of G-methods in the health sciences [@williams2021; @díaz2021; @breskin2021]. However, G-methods have yet to be widely employed by cultural evolutionary researchers. causal diagrams are important because they help to clarify the fact that standard methods -- including multi-level regression models -- will fail to recover natural causal effects from time-series data in which there is treatment-confounder feedback.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-9
#| fig-cap: "Exposure confounder feedback is a problem for time-series models. If we do not condition on L_t2, a backdoor path is open from A_t3 to Y_t4. However, if conditioning on L_t2 introduces collider bias, opening a path, coloured in red,  between A_t2 and Y_t4. Here, we may not use conventional methods to estimate the effects of multiple exposures.  Instead, at best, we may only simulate controlled effects using G-methods. Multi-level models will eliminate bias. Currently, outside of epidemiology, G-methods are rarely used. causal diagrams are useful for clarifying the damned either way confounding control strategies that lead traditional methods to fail."

The problem becomes accute when the exposures $A_{t1}$ affects the outcome $Y_{t4}$. Consider: because $L_{t2}$ is along the path from $A_{t1}$ to $Y_{t4}$ conditioning on $L_{t2}$ partially blocks the path between the exposure and the outcome. Conditioning on $L_{t2}$ in this setting induces both collider stratification bias and mediator bias. Yet we must condition on $L_{t2}$ to block the open backdoor path between $L_{t2}$ and $Y_{t4}$. The general problem of exposure-confounder feedback is described in [@hernan2023b]. This problem presents a serious issue for cultural evolutionary studies. The bad news is that nearly traditional regression based methods cannot address this problem. Causality is not identified from time-series data with feedback. The good news, again, is that we may obtain controlled effect estimates in these settings using G-methods , where there have been many recent developments. The scope and application of these methods is beyond the scope of this tutorial.[^15]

[^15]: Relatedly, to assess the identification of controlled effect estimates benefits from graphical methods such as "single world intervention graphs" or "SWIGS." SWIGS represent counterfactual outcomes on the graph. However, in their general form, SWIGS are templates and not causal diagrams. Their application, too, is beyond the scope of this tutorial see: [@richardson2013]

### Summary Part 2

To estimate causal effects we must contrast the world as it has been with the world as it might have been. For many big questions in cultural evolution, we have seen confounder-treatment feedback leads to intractable identification problems. We have also seen that causal diagrams are useful for clarifying these problems. I next turn to three-wave designs for estimating the total causal effects. Such designs have applications for a broad class of cultural evolutionary questions, and may be especially useful for evolutionary anthropologists who wish to collect time-series data in the present to address causal questions about cultural evolution as it is occurring in the world today.

## Part 3. Applications: the three wave panel design.

In this section, we explore how temporally ordered causal diagrams can illuminate the utility of a three-wave panel design for addressing causal questions using data as described by @vanderweele2020. Here is how we can address causal questions with three waves of data.

### Step 1. Examine the utility of a three-wave panel design through temporally ordered causal diagram

In this section, we examine into how temporally ordered causal diagrams can highlight the effectiveness of a three-wave panel design in addressing causal questions, as elaborated by @vanderweele2020. Consider how to approach causal questions with three waves of data.

###  Step 2. Specify the exposure and measure it at wave 0 and wave 1.

Initially, we need a well-defined exposure. Unless our interest is in causal interaction, causal mediation, or sequential treatment regimes, we will investigate the total effect of only one exposure. Suppose we are interested in investigating the causal effect of religious service attendance. Our first task is to explicitly state the the exposure as a hypothetical intervention: Is our interest in any attendance versus non-attendance?, weekly attendance versus monthly attendance?  or some other state. Imagining a hypothetical experiment, even if not feasible, helps to focus on the need to state a clear intervention [@hernán2022a].

In a three-wave panel design, we must measure the exposure both at baseline and at the second wave. This dual measurement strategy plays a crucial role in the effort to use observational data to replicate the design of a controlled experiment. When an exposure is recorded at the baseline and the second wave, we ensure that what we are assessing is the effect of the "incident exposure" - an exposure newly occurring between the first and second waves. This is distinct from the "prevalent exposure," that is the frequency of the distribution of exposure in the population at baseline [@danaei2012; @hernan2023]. By controlling for baseline exposure we more effectively emulate an experimental manipulation of a factor of interest, wherein an intervention is applied at a particular point in time and subsequent changes are observed. Consider how biase might occur if the exposure is initially harmful to the outcome. Suppose we only measure the exposure at the second wave and ignore the initial exposure at baseline (see: @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2.). In that case, we might wrongly infer that the exposure is benefitial [@hernán2008a; @hernán2016a].

An further advantage of controlling for the exposure at baseline is that it can reduce the probability of bias that might arise if there is an unmeasured confounder affecting both the outcome and the initial exposure, irrespective of the previous exposure levels. 

#### **Caution: if the exposure is rare, large amounts of data must be collected to estimate causal effects**

Suppose that in the non religious population the switch from zero religious service attendance to weekly religious service attendance rarely: say 1 in 1,000 non attenders per year. To obtain an effective sample for a "treatment" group while conditioning on a rich set of might not be feasible without 100s of thousands of participants. One might be better to consider change within the religious population, assuming the change is more common in this population. However, in this case, we would not generally estimate a causal effect that would transport to the non-religious population. We would rather estimate a causal effect that generalised to the religious population from which the sample was drawn. 

###  Step 3. Specify the outcome(s) and measure them at wave 0 and wave 2

After defining the exposure, we need a to state a well-defined outcome, or outcomes. In our case, we might be interested in the effect of gaining or losing religious beliefs on the frequency of volunteering (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Note that vague concepts such as "the societal effects of religious change" do not lead us toward understanding causality. We must specify what we mean by "religious change" by identifying an intervention, and by "societal effect" through stating a measurable outcome that occurs post-intervention. In a three-wave panel design, the outcomes are recorded at baseline (for confounding control) and at the third wave, the wave subsequent to the exposure. Although we are typically restricted to estimating the effect of one exposure at a time, we are not restricted to estimating the effects of the exposure on only one outcome. Indeed it has been argued that we should evaluate an anatomy of response across as many exposures as are relevant to the domain of interest @vanderweele2020. Such an "outcome-wide" approach is motivated from the desire to accellerate scientific progress while avoiding cherry picked analyses. 


In a three-wave panel design, the outcomes must be recorded at baseline (for confounding control) and at +2 wave from baseline. It is important to control for the outcome measured at baseline -- the 'baseline outcome' --  to confirm the correct temporal order of the cause-effect relationship, i.e. to avoid reverse causation. Moreover, when the exposure is also controlled for at baseline, then for an unmeasured confounder to explain away the association between exposure at +1 waves from baseline and the outcome at +2 waves from baseline, it would need to do so independently of the baseline effect. This scenario is presented in @fig-dag-6. This causal diagram makes and important practical point. Although confounding might not be entirely eliminated (the dashed arrows represent the potential for uncontrolled sources of bias), data-collection and analysis can nevertheless diminish bias. Because we can almost never be certain we have controlled for unmeasured confounding it is important for researchers to perform sensitivity analysis. (A topic we do not examine here.)

```


###  Step 4. Identify observable common causes of the exposure and the outcome, and group them under simplified labels

Next, we should identify all the potential confounders that, when adjusted for, can eliminate any non-causal association between the exposure and outcome. We should group these confounders under labels where possible. In a three-wave panel design, these confounders are typically recorded during the baseline wave, preceding the exposure. As illustrated in @fig-dag-mediator-solution, recording confounders before exposure minimises the potential for mediation bias.

###  Step 5. Gather data for proxy variables of unmeasured common causes at the baseline wave

If there exist any unmeasured factors influencing both the exposure and outcome, but we lack direct measurements for them, efforts should be made to include proxies for these factors, as outlined in @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2. Again, even if this strategy cannot be ensured to elimitate bias, it may reduce bias from unmeasured confounding.


###  Step 6. State the target population for whom the causal question applies

We need to define for whom our causal inference applies. For this purpose, it is useful to distinguish the concepts of source population and target population, and between the concepts of generalisability and transportability.

  1. **The source population** is the population from whom our sample is drawn. 

  2. **The target population** is the larger group for which we aim to apply our study's results. The closer the source matches the target in ways that are relevant to our causal questions, the stronger our causal inferences about the target population will be.

  3. **Generalisability** refers to the ability to apply the causal effects estimated from a sample to the source population. Researchers in the human sciences know this concept as "external validity." Where:

  a.  $PATE$ denotes the population average treatment effect for the target population.
  b.  $ATE_{\text{source}}$ denotes the average treatment effect in the source population.
  c.  $W$ denotes a set of variables upon which the source and target population might differ when the research interest is in transporting resultes to a population other than that from which the source population is drawn.
  d.  $T$ denotes a set of variables upon which the source and the target population might differ when the interest is in generalising beyond the population from which the source population is drawn.

  We may define *generalisability* as:

$$PATE =  f(ATE_{\text{source}}, W)$$

  Results generalise if the population average treatment effect in the target population can be expressed as a function of the average treatment effect in the source population and the set of variables, $W$, which differentiate the two populations. This function is a mapping of the average treatment effect from the source population, adjusted for the observed differences between the populations, represented by $W$. Here, $f$ could be a model or a set of transformations capturing the relationship between the source and target populations' treatment effects, conditioned on $W$. It might involve rescaling, weighting, or modelling interactions.

  4. **Transportability** refers to the ability to extrapolate causal effects learned from a source population to a target population. It pertains to the transfer of causal knowledge across different settings or populations such that

$$ATE_{\text{target}} \approx f(ATE_{\text{source}}, T)$$

This function similarly maps the average treatment effect from the source population to a target population. However, the target population in this case differs from the population from which the source was drawn. The structures that enable inference are denoted by $T$. The function over $T$ might be more complex, as it must handle potential heterogeneity of effects and unobserved sources of bias. To assess transportability we generally requier information about both the source and target populations and an understanding of how the relationships between treatment, outcome, and covariates might differ between the two populations. Assessing transportability typically requires additional data or specialist knowledge. In Section 4, we consider the concepts of generalisability and transportability as they relate to sample selection.

### Step 7. Retention is critical

For reasons we clarify in Part 4, retention of the original sample is vital. Panel attrition not increases uncertainty by reducing the effective sample size of a study at baseline, it opens novel pathways for bias. Researchers must develop protocols for tracking individuals over time as they change address, email, phone numbers, and names. Moreover, developing and implementing strategies for motivating retention of across the entire population of interest (not merely those willing to volunteer for science) is critical for effective causal human science. These strategies must be developed with specialist knowledge of the population under study, and with the participation of people being studied -- a topic for another article. 

### Summmary Part 3.

The general strategy for confounding control by three-wave panel designs may be summarised in @fig-dag-6. The graph is adapted from @vanderweele2020 three-wave panel design. The blue-dotted line indicates the possibility for unmeasured confounding even after diminishing bias by including baseline measures for the exposure and outcome. The causal diagram shows that for an unmeasured confounder $U$ to bias the exposure $A_{t1}\to Y_{t2}$ association it would need to do so independently of these baseline measures of the exposure $A_{t0}$ and exposure $Y_{t0}$.  @fig-dag-6 furthermore shows how panel researchers may address reverse causation by controlling for both the exposure and outcome at baseline.  @fig-dag-6 also reveals obtain an estimate for the incidence of the effect rather than its prevelance. Finally  @fig-dag-6 graph shows that by measuring confounders before the exposure and the exposure before the outcome, we reduce the potential for collider stratification and mediator bias, which, as we saw in Part 2 arises when we unwittingly condition on a post-treatment variable. Overall we discover that it is not enough to draw causal diagrams. Causal diagrams reveal the mission-critical need for collecting repeated measures data with particular attributes. 


## Part 4. Selection bias in the three wave panel design


### Selection bias at the start of study

Selection bias may be defined generally the bias that arises when the parameter of interest in a target population differs from the parameter of interest in the subset of the population available for analysis -- that is from the source population [@hernán2017]. The source population may differ from the target population in descriptive parameters. In causal inference we are typically interested in how selection bias may affect causal effect measures -- that is, in how such difference affect causal contrasts on the some scale of interest (difference, risk ratio, etc.) Here, we shall consider how causal diagrams greatly facilitate progress in understanding such threats. Before examining how, consider the following topology of confounding developed by Suzuki and colleagues[@suzuki2016; @suzuki2014; @suzuki2020], building on work by Tyler VanderWeele [@vanderweele2012]:

  1. **Confounding in distribution**: we say there is no confounding in distribution of the effect of the exposure on an outcome if the group that received each level of the exposure is representative of the target population. 

  2.  **Confounding in expectation**: we say there is no confounding in expectation of the effect of the exposure on an outcome if the exposure assignment mechanism results in balance of confounders across each level of the exposure to be contrasted.

  3. **Confounding in measure**: there is no confounding in measure of the effect of the exposure on an outcome if a particular measure of interest is equivalent to the corresponding causal measure in the target population. This concept is important because, as we noted in our discussion of interaction, whether we infer a causal effect may depend on the scale of the causal effect measure. An effect may be present on the difference scale but not present on the relative-risk scale, and vice versa. If selection introduces an effect modifier, the scale at which an effect is measured may affect whether an how results generalise (or transport) from the source to target population. 

  4. **Realised confounding**: we say there is no realised confounding of the effect of the exposure on an outcome if a particular exposure assignment results in balance, irrespective of the exposure assignment mechanism. This concept is important because even in randomised experiments, randomisation may fail to remove chance imbalances in the distributions of confounders in the exposures. We may have no confounding in expectation yet the experimental effect estimate might differ for the source and target populations. 
  
Eaach of these four concepts is variously used in discussions of "confounding." All are important when evaluating the scientific contribution of a study. Yet each concept brings different issues into focus.

With these distinction to hand, consider @fig-selection-under-the-null, which presents a scenario in which there is no (marginal) causal effect of the exposure on the outcome, yet there is selection into the study. We imagine randomisation such that there is no path from any other node into $A$. Let us assume randomisation succeeded.  Finally, we imagine there there is no causal path from $A \to Y$. As evident in @fig-selection-under-the-null there is no confounding in the expectation, nor is there confounding in distribution. The null effect estimate returned from the study will honour the true null effect in the population. We might say that selection does lead to "confounding in distribution for confounding in expectation." Or more simply, despite selection, the null effect in the source population is unbiased for the target population. Our null results generalise (see: [@hernán2004b], see also [@greenlands.1977a]).

```

@fig-selection-off-the-null presents a different scenario in which there selection bias for the population parameter: the association in the population of selected individuals differs from the causal association in the target population. Hernán calls this "selection bias off the null" [@hernán2017] and Lu et al call this "type 2 selection bias" [@lu2022a] This bias occurs because the selection into the study occurs on an effect modifier for the effect of the exposure on the outcome. In this scenario there is what Suzuki et al call "confounding in distribution for the confounding in expectation." That is, although the causal effect of $A\to Y$ is unbiased for the exposed and unexposed in the source population, the effect estimate does not generalise to the exposed and unexposed in the target population: $PATE \cancel{\approx} ATE_{\text{sample}}$.

\end{tikzpicture}
```

There has been considerable work investigating the conditions under which causal estimates for a target population may be identified when the source population differs from the target population [@lu2022a], i.e. whether we may obtain a function such that $PATE =  f(ATE_{\text{source}}, W)$. Whether results transport to populations that systematically differ from the source population --  i.e. whether we may obtain a function such that $ATE_{\text{target}} \approx f(ATE_{\text{source}}, T)$ -- is also an area of active research [@bareinboim2022a; @deffner2022a]. As @@lu2022a point out, type 2 selection bias should be addressed during the design and analytic stage by accurately measuring and properly adjust for a sufficient set of covariates that affect selection $\framebox{S}$ and the outcome in the target population. Moreover, as @suzuki2020 suggest, when drawing a causal diagramme, it is vital to present confounding as it exists in the target population (see especially their examples in the appendix.)

In panel designs there is additionally a constant threat of selection occurring *after* enrolment into the study.  We next put chronological causal diagrams to use in making sense of this threat, and to derive practical advice.

### Selection bias in which both the exposure and outcome affect selection

We next use causal diagrams to clarify biases arising from panel attrition. Panel attrition can be viewed as a special case of selection bias because the participants who continue in a longitudinal study may differ from those who drop out in ways that generate structural biases.

@fig-dag-8-5, describes a scenario in one in which both the exposure and the true outcome affect panel attrition, biasing the observed association between the exposure and the measured outcome in the remaining sample. Here we present the problem as an instance of collider stratification bias. The problem can be equivalently viewed as one of directed measurement error, described in the next section in @fig-dag-indep-d-effect. Either way, restricting analysis to the retained sample introduces bias in the the causal effect estimate by opening a backdoor path from the exposure to the outcome.

### Selection bias in a three-wave panel

Figure @fig-dag-8 shows selection bias manifest in a three-wave panel design when loss-to-follow-up results in a systematic disparity between the baseline and follow-up source populations. The red dashed lines in the diagram represent an open back-door path, symbolising a potential indirect association between the exposure and the outcome. Upon considering only the selected sample (i.e., when we condition on the selected sample $\framebox{S}$), we may create or obscure associations that would not be evident in the original source population at baseline.

### Unmeasured confounder affects outcome and variable that affects attrition

Figure @fig-dag-8-2 presents another problem of selection bias in a three-wave panel design. This diagram shows how an unmeasured confounder, U$_S$, can simultaneously influence the outcome variable Y$_{t2}$ and another variable, L$_{t2}$, responsible for attrition (i.e., the drop-out rate, denoted as $\framebox{S}$). In this instance, the exposure variable, $A_{t1}$, can impact L$_{t2}$, which subsequently affects attrition, $\framebox{S}$. If the study's selected sample descends from L$_2$, the selection effectively conditions on L$_{t2}$, introducing potential bias into the analysis. The diagram marks this possible biasing pathway with red-dashed lines. Ordering the nodes chronologically elucidates the temporal sequence of these events, allowing for a clearer assessment of potential bias sources relevant to a three-wave panel design. 

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-8-2

Such conditioning opens a biasing path, indicated by the red-dashed lines."

### Summary Part 4

In this section, we have used causal diagrams to clarify sources of confounding arising from selection bias in the setting of longitudinal research, revealing further scope for the practical applications of causal diagrams when planning research.  The key advice is as follows.

1. To ensure generalisability, wherever possible, sample broadly from the target population. Ensure that all effect-modifiers are measured. To better assess the role that effect-modification may play, draw your causal diagramme for the target population.

2. Ensure the strongest possible retention of your sample. Ideally we would retain all participants. However, perfect retention is almost always impractical. When estimating causal effects, researchers must instead employ methods such as multiple-imputation or inverse probability of censoring weights to restore balance. These are not fail-safe methods. I reiterate the need for sensitivity analyses.



## Part 5. Measurement and confounding in the three wave panel design

Here we causal diagrams to clarify bias from measurement error, revealing  implications for research design. Following @hernán2009, we first define  structural concepts of measurement error and draw causal diagrams to understand how they may bias causal effect estimates (see also [@vanderweele2012a]).

#### 1. **Uncorrelated non-differential (undirected) measurement error**

As shown in @fig-dag-uu-null, uncorrelated non-differential measurement error occurs when the errors in measurement of the exposure and outcome are not related.  

To clarify,consider again the task of estimating the causal effect of beliefs in big Gods on social complexity. Suppose ancient societies randomly omitted or recorded details about both beliefs in Big Gods and indicators of social complexity in their records. Or equivalently, suppose that such records were not preserved equally across cultures for reasons unrelated to these parameters. In this case, errors in the documentation of both variables would be random. That is, the errors would not be related to the intensity of the beliefs in Big Gods or the level of social complexity. This example provides an instance of uncorrelated and non-differential error, and is presented in @fig-dag-uu-null.

Uncorrelated non-differential measurement error does not create bias under the null. As evident from @fig-dag-uu-null, d-separation is preserved. Our equivalently, there are no open back doors on the graph. However, when there is a true effect of the exposure on the outcome, non-differential measurement error generally leads to an attenuation of the true effect estimate. For this reason, uncorrelated non-differential measurement error can be problematic for inference even though it does not induce structural bias under the null.

#### 2. **Uncorrelated differential (directed) measurement error**

As shown in @fig-dag-indep-d-effect, uncorrelated differential (or directed) measurement error occurs when the errors in measurement are related to the level of exposure or outcome, but not to each other. For instance, societies with stronger 'beliefs in Big Gods' might cause a society to provide more or less detailed records of 'social complexity'. However, in the absence of any intervention on beliefs in Gods, there is no association between the measurement errors. Here, the errors are differential as they depend on the intensity of religious beliefs, but uncorrelated as the errors in documenting 'beliefs in Big Gods' and 'social complexity' are otherwise independent of each other. Uncorrelated differential (or directed) measurement error is presented in @fig-dag-indep-d-effect and leads to bias under the null, indicated by the red path. Or equivalently, uncorrelated differential (or directed) measurement error opens a back-door path between the exposure and the outcome.

Note that the bias presented in @fig-dag-indep-d-effect, which is an example of directed measurement error, also describes the bias we considered when there is panel attrition, and which the exposure and affects selection (see: @fig-dag-8-5). In that scenario, the outcome in the selected group is measured with error -- it no long represents the measurement of the outcome in the source population at baseline -- and further more, this error is affected by the exposure. The previous example described bias in estimation from the vantage point of collider stratification, however the example may be equally explained from the more general vantage point of directed measurement bias.

#### 3. **Correlated non-differential (undirected) measurement error**

As shown @fig-dag-dep-u-effect correlated non-differential (undirected) measurement error occurs when the errors in measuring both the exposure and outcome are related to each other, but not to the level of exposure or outcome. The scenario is presented in @fig-dag-dep-u-effect. Imagine that some societies had more advanced record-keeping systems that resulted in more accurate and detailed accounts of both 'beliefs in Big Gods' and 'social complexity' and furthermore that the record keepers provide better information about religious beliefs. These errors between beliefs in big Gods and social complexity might be correlated because the accuracy of records on both variables is influenced by the same underlying factor (the record-keeping abilities), but they are non-differential insofar as true religious beliefs and true social complexity do not affect bias in the record keeping. Correlated non-differential measurement error may induce bias under the null, indicated by the red path in @fig-dag-dep-u-effect.

#### 4. **Correlated differential (directed) measurement error**

As presented in @fig-dag-d-d, correlated differential (directed) measurement error occurs when the errors in measurement are related to each other and also to the level of exposure or outcome. Suppose that societies with stronger beliefs in big Gods tend to record their both their religious beliefs and social structure in more detail and that this work conducted by religious elites. In this case, the errors may be both correlated and differential if societies with beliefs in big Gods tend to favour the religious elites who keep biased records.

### Comparative research viewed as correlated undirected measurment error

Against invariance testing, we should approach comparative research from the vantage point of correlated measurement error. Amending @fig-dag-dep-u-effect. Selecting on unmeasured correlated error structures in the world we have @fig-dag-dep-u-effect-selection.

Were we to select from a setting in which there was no systematic (correlated) error structures between the measurements of the exposures and the measurements of the outcomes we would avoid such confounding.

Note that it is not merely a matter of transporting results from the sample population to another population. Rather, the act of selection induces bias.

<!-- ### Measurement error in the three-wave panel design -->

<!-- Cultural evolutionary researchers who design panel studies may wish to use constructs that are composed of multiple-items. A tradition in psychometric theory encourages the use of composite constructs. Classical psychometric theory was developed in the absence of causal theories. Recent work has clarified that the assumptions of a univariate underlying reality that forms the basis of the formative and reflective latent factor models are much stronger than has been recognised in psychometric literatures [@vanderweele2022a], and indeed the empirically falsifiable assumptions, when tested, do not hold up to scrutiny [@vanderweele2022b]. @vanderweele2022a extends the formalism of the theory of causal inference under multiple interventions to salvage latent factor models by showing that they may still be valid under the assumptions of a complex multi-variate underlying reality giving rise to these factors. We examine these important issues in Appendix 2, and much more could be said. For now, however, we write our measured variables as functions of indicators, such that the true underlying reality of, for example, the exposure is measured by a function of indicators $A_{f(A_1\dots A_n)}^{}$ which measure the coarsened state $A_\eta$ with error, denoted $U_A$. -->

<!-- Additional potential for confounding arises when we consider the possibilities of correlated and directed confounding. @fig-dag-dep-undir-effect-confounders-3wave presents paths such confounding opens between the measured exposure and measured outcome. -->

<!-- Consider our a three-wave panel design. We want to consistently estimate the effect of self-reported religious service attendance (exposure $A_{t1}$) on self-reported monthly donations to charity (outcome $Y_{t2}$). At baseline, a set of confounders $L_{t0}$ is included. This set comprises previous measures of religious service attendance and monthly donations to charity. -->

<!-- Because the data rely on self-reports, there is inherent measurement error involved in the data collection process. We present this scenario in @fig-dag-dep-undir-effect-confounders-3wave. The measurement error for the exposure is denoted by $U_A$, for the outcome by $U_Y$, and for the confounders at baseline by $U_L$. -->

<!-- Now, suppose there is an unmeasured common cause $U_{LA}$ that affects both the measurement error of religious service attendance (part of confounders $L_{t0}$) and exposure $A_{t1}$. This might occur, for instance, if the same individuals have a consistent bias in over- or under-reporting their religious service attendance over time, perhaps from social desirability bias. -->

<!-- Similarly, there could be an unmeasured common cause $U_{AY}$ influencing both the measurement error of exposure $A_{t1}$ and outcome $Y_{t2}$. This could occur if individuals who over-report their religious service attendance also tend to over-report their monthly donations to charity, perhaps arising from a general propensity to exaggerate altruistic behaviours. -->

<!-- Lastly, an unmeasured common cause $U_{LY}$ could affect the measurement error of confounders $L_{t0}$ and outcome $Y_{t2}$. This might be the case if individuals who over- or under-report their baseline religious service attendance or donations also consistently misreport their donations at the later time point. -->

<!-- These unmeasured common causes ($U_{LA}$, $U_{AY}$, $U_{LY}$) represent instances of correlated measurement error because they induce correlation between the errors in different variables in the study, thereby potentially biasing the observed associations between exposure, outcome, and confounders. -->

<!-- Note that including the measured exposure at baseline can help reduce confounding in a from measurement error in a three-wave panel design. By controlling for the baseline exposure, we effectively adjust for any persistent, static characteristics that might influence both the exposure at time 1 ($A_{t1}$) and the outcome at time 2 ($Y_{t2}$), thus enabling us to focus more precisely on the incidence effect. -->

<!-- Concerning measurement error, including baseline measures could mitigate the impact of these errors on causal effect estimation, provided that these errors are random and not systematically linked across time points. However, if there are correlated errors --- for instance, if individuals consistently over- or under-report their exposure or outcome across time - such systematic errors these could still introduce bias in the estimated incidence effects. -->

<!-- Suppose, for example, that people attend religious service more at time 1 also acquire more social desirability bias, meaning they may become more likely to over-report socially desirable behaviors or under-report socially undesirable ones. In this case, if the measuerd outcome at time 2 is charitable giving (a socially desirable behavior), the augmented social desirability bias from increased religious service could cause an over-estimation of the true level of giving. If we were simply to compare reported charity at T2 with reported church attendance at T1, we might mistakenly attribute the apparent increase in charity to the increase in religious service, when it was social desirability bias that led to over-reporting. The causal effect of the increase in religious service on giving might be less than it appears, or even non-existent. -->

<!-- Therefore, it is crucial in a three-wave panel design to carefully consider potential sources of bias like this one, and to attempt to account for them in the analysis to get a more accurate picture of the true causal relationships. Although controlling for baseline exposure is a powerful strategy for isolating incidence effects and controlling confounding, it is not a panacea for all sources of bias. Attention to the quality of the measures at all time points remains paramount. For example, in the case we just described to avoid presentation bias, one might focus on question that ascertain whether one has received help from the community, rather than questions that ask people to report the amount of help they have given. -->

## How controlling for baseline measures mitigates against correlated measurement errors

Controlling for a baseline measure of the exposure and the outcome is essentially controlling for potential confounding caused by any time-invariant characteristics that might influence both the exposure and the outcome. Such confounding is suppressed because any effect of these characteristics on the outcome is supposed to be the same at baseline and at follow-up, assuming no interaction with time. 

When it comes to measurement error, the situation is somewhat different. If the exposure and outcome are both measured with error, and the errors are correlated, this would typically introduce bias in our estimate of the causal effect. We have seen that if this this error is systematic and non-differential, it may lead to an attenuation of the estimated causal effect.

Including baseline measurements of the exposure and outcome in our model can, in theory, help mitigate this bias. This is because the model would, in effect, be using the change in the exposure and outcome from baseline to follow-up to estimate the causal effect. If the measurement error is consistent across time (i.e., it is a constant amount or a constant proportion of the true value), then using these change scores could help to control for it. 

However, this assumes that the measurement error has no directionality and is not differential with respect to time. If the measurement error varies over time or in relation to other variables in the model, then controlling for baseline measurements may not fully correct for it. 

Here is a simple mathematical representation of the conditions. Let $A_0$, $A_1$ denote the exposure at baseline and follow-up, and let $Y_0$, $Y_1$ denote the outcome at baseline and follow-up. The true values are denoted without primes, and the measured values with primes. We assume the measurement error is additive:

$A'_0 = A_0 + U_0$,

$A'_1 = A_1 + A_1$,

$Y'_0 = Y_0 + V_0$,

$Y'_2 = Y_2 + V_2$,

where $U_0$, $U_1$ are the measurement errors for the exposure at baseline and follow-up, and $V_0$, $V_2$ are the measurement errors for the outcome at baseline and follow-up. If the errors are correlated, then $Cov(U_0, V_0) \neq 0$ and/or $Cov(U_1, V_2) \neq 0$. 

In a model that includes $A'_0$ and $Y'_0$ as covariates, the estimated effect of $A'_1$ on $Y'_2$ is essentially the estimated effect of the change in the exposure from baseline to follow-up on the change in the outcome from baseline to follow-up, controlling for the baseline measures. This will mitigate the bias arising from to correlated errors if the following conditions hold:

$E(U_0) = E(U_1)$ and $E(V_0) = E(V_2)$ (i.e., the expectation of the measurement errors does not change over time),

$Cov(U_0, V_2) = Cov(U_1, V_2)$ (i.e., the correlation between the errors does not change over time). 

If these conditions do not hold, then the bias may not be fully controlled for, and other methods may be needed.[^note_measure_control] 

[^note_measure_control]: I have assumed that the measurement errors are additive and undirected. If the errors are multiplicative or have some other form, or if they vary with the level of the true values or with other variables in the model, then this simple analysis might not apply.


### Casual diagrams clarify the structural assumptions underlying classical measurement theory

Researchers working in cultural evolution often incorporate multi-item constructs into their panel study designs, a practice which is aligned with the recommendations of conventional psychometric theory. However, classical psychometric theory emerged without the benefit of causal theories. As noted by Tyler VanderWeele, issues arise when evaluating the causal assumptions of formative and reflective models [@vanderweele2022]. Let us first consider the issues before expanding on how they manifest in panel research.

There are two prevailing approaches in this area: formative and reflective models. The focus here will be on reflective models, though it should be noted that the issues identified also apply to formative models, as outlined by VanderWeele [@vanderweele2022][^note_formative].

[^note_formative]: In a formative model, the observed variables are thought to cause the latent variable. As in the reflective model, there is a single latent variable. This latent variable, however, is considered the effect of the underlying indicators. In mathematical terms, if $\eta$ represents the latent variable, $\lambda_i$ denotes the weight for $X_i$ (the observed variable), and $\varepsilon$ is the error term, the latent variable $\eta$ can be described as a composite of the observed variables $X_i$, expressed as: $\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i$. 

In a reflective model, researchers posit that a latent variable gives rise to the observed indicators. Each observed variable (or indicator) is seen as a 'reflection' or manifestation of the latent variable. If $X_i$ is an observed variable (indicator), $\lambda_i$ is the factor loading for $X_i$, $\eta$ is the latent variable, and $\varepsilon_i$ is the error term associated with $X_i$, the reflective model can be formulated as:

$$X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$$

Factor analysis typically assumes a common latent variable, which is responsible for the correlations observed among the indicators. The causal assumptions linked to this concept are demonstrated in Figure @fig-dag-latent-1.

\end{tikzpicture}
```

The statistical implications of the **reflective model** suggest that the observed variables (indicators) are reflections or manifestations of the latent variable, which is mathematically expressed as $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$. The factor analytic tradition goes one step further by proposing a structural assumption that a univariate latent variable causally affects the observed variables. Hence, the reflective model yields $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$, which is assumed to underpin the structural assumptions shown in Figure @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model.

VanderWeele notices that while the statistical model $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$ concurs with the structural assumptions in Figure @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model, it can also align with various causal models. For instance, the statistical model is compatible with the reality presented in @ fig_dag_multivariate_reality_again, where unique latent variables give rise to distinct indicators, some of which (but not necessarily all) have a causal effect on the outcome. The statistical model does not provide clarity about which structural model is accurate. Additionally, the assumption that a univariate underlying reality forms the basis of the formative and reflective latent factor models, which is a much stronger assumption than has been previously acknowledged in psychometric literature. For widely used measures these assumptions fail to withstand empirical scrutiny [@vanderweele2022b].

VanderWeele suggests that construct measures can still be utilised in applied research by extending the theory of causal inference under multiple interventions to factor models [@vanderweele2022a] (for a detailed discussion, refer to Appendix 1). 

By expressing our measured variables as functions of indicators, and assuming the true underlying reality as a coarsened measure of a potentially complex latent reality, we can consistently estimate causal effects under this extended theory. This approach is illustrated in @fig-dag-multiple-version-treatment-applied-measurement.

### Causal diagrammes reveal matters are worse when the components of constructs are measured withe error. 

Consider a three wave panel where, for simplicity, we assume no unmeasured confounding is present. Our exposure $A$ can be measured by a function of indicators, denoted as $A_{f(A_1, A_2, ..., A_n)}$, forming a coarsened state from a multivariate reality. Each element of this reality has a corresponding structural component, denoted as $\eta_{A_1}, \eta_{A_2}, ..., \eta_{A_n}$. These components are measured with their respective error terms, $U\eta_{A_1}, U\eta_{A_2}, ..., U\eta_{A_n}$.

Similar to the exposure, our outcome Y can be conceptualised as a function of indicators, $Y_{f(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n)}$, of a latent reality. This reality is expressed through the latent components $\eta_{Y_1}, \eta_{Y_2}, ..., \eta_{Y_n}$, each having their associated error term $U\eta_{Y_1}, U\eta_{Y_2}, ..., U\eta_{Y_n}$.

@fig-dag-coarsen-measurement-error illustrates the assumed reality. It shows possible paths for confounding via directed measurement error. Each path is represented by a structural component $\eta_{A_n}$ and its associated error term $U\eta_{Y_n}$. Here we present three possible confounding paths that are possible from directed measurement error.

Note that the potential for confounding arising from measurement error in panel designs depends fundamentally on the particular relationships and dependencies among variables, not merely their quantity. However, we can see here that, theoretically, a larger number of latent states or error terms could amplify the possibilities for confounding. In a simplistic scenario, *every* latent variable associated with an exposure could affect each error term of an outcome, leading to an expansive network of confounding paths. 

This underscores thinking very carefully about the composite terms when using psychological constructs. In many cases researchers might wish to use single item measures. However, general rule here is not possible. Every case must be considered with careful attention to the meanings of the items, their likely interpretations, and their potential causal underpinnings over time.

### Summary Part 5.

In Part 5, the focus is on understanding measurement and confounding errors in the three-wave panel design using causal diagrams. We discuss four types of measurement errors and how they may affect research results. These include uncorrelated non-differential (undirected) measurement error, uncorrelated differential (directed) measurement error, correlated non-differential (undirected) measurement error, and correlated differential (directed) measurement error.

Within a three-wave panel design, I discussed an example where the estimation of the effect of self-reported religious service attendance on self-reported monthly donations to charity might be influenced by systematic errors.

I emphasised that while adjusting for baseline exposure can help reduce confounding and isolate incidence effects, it is not a solution for all biases. Attention must be given to the quality of measurements at all time points and the design of the questions to avoid potential biases, such as presentation bias. causal diagrams are helpful in clarifying these complex structures confounding. 


### Conclusions

### Summary of advice

1.  **Define all variables clearly**: Ensure that all variables in your causal graph are distinctly defined.

2.  **Define novel conventions**: if you are using unique conventions in your diagram, such as coloured arrows to indicate induced confounding, make sure to define them.

3.  **Embrace minimalism**: include only the nodes and edges that clarify the problem at hand. Diagrams should be used when they provide clarity beyond what can be achieved by textual descriptions alone. That clarity is enhance by drawing only as much complexity as is needed to identify sources of counfounding and develop strategies for minimising bias.

4.  **Ensure the graph is Acyclic**

5.  **Maintain chronological order in the spatial organisation**: organise nodes in temporal sequence, usually from left to right or top to bottom. If depicting repeated measures, use time subscripts for clarity.

*Note that chronologically ordered causal diagrams are ordinary causal diagrams whose spatial properties help to improve strategies for addressing bias in causal estimation.* They are not structurally different from non-chronologically ordered causal diagrams. However, we shall see that by maintaining chronological order we may greatly enhance the effectiveness of the tool.

6.  **Generally, time-stamp your nodes**: it is often useful to time-stamp nodes for clearer temporal understanding, for example, $L_{t0} \rightarrow A_{t1} \rightarrow Y_{t2}$.

7.  **Included nodes for unmeasured confounding**: when exposures are not assigned randomly, assume the existence of unmeasured confounding. Plan for sensitivity analyses to gauge the impact of unmeasured confounding on your findings.

8.  **Include nodes for selection**: when applicable, include nodes for selection variables. This helps to understand potential sources of selection bias in your study.

9.  **Consider mediators and interactions**: when mediation or interaction is of interest, these should be appropriately represented in the diagram. However, be mindful not to attempt to represent non-linear relationships graphically.

10. **Appreciate the qualitative role of causal diagrams**: remember, causal diagrams serve as qualitative visual tools rather than quantitative models. When strategies like time stamps are implemented, they are used for maintaining sufficient clarity in chronological order needed to understand potential confounding. They need not denote specific time intervals. Again we should aim for simplicity in our causal DAGs - include only the level of detail necessary to elucidate strategies for controlling confounding.

11. **Measurement error** It is generally important to include measurement error on the graph.

Topics not covered:

1.  **Signed edges**
2.  **SWIGS**
3. **Need for time -- comment on funding**

### Stray points to address

1.  Structural equation models are not causal diagrams
2.  causal diagrams are non-parametric
3.  causal diagrams represent interactions $A -- > Y <--- B$ (two arrows into the outcome)
4.  We may distinguish between effect modification and interaction.

<!-- ## Appendix 1 how causal diagrams work -->

<!-- Key concepts are as follows: -->

<!-- -   **Markov Factorisation:** Pertains to a causal diagramme in which the joint distribution of all nodes can be expressed as a product of conditional distributions. Each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants, given its parents. This is crucial for identifying conditional independencies within the graph. -->

<!-- -   **D-separation (direction separation):** Pertains to a condition in which there is no path between some sets of variables in the graph, given the conditioned variables. Establishing d-separation allows us to infer conditional independencies between the exposure and counterfactual outcomes, which in turn help identify the set of measured variables we need to adjust for in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. -->

<!-- ### Assumption of causal diagrams -->

<!-- The **Causal Markov Condition** is an assumption that each variable is independent of its non-descendants, given its parents in the graph. If two variables are correlated, it is because one causes the other, or because both share a common cause, not because of any confounding variables not included in the graph -->

<!-- Formally, for each variable $A$ in the graph, $A$ is independent of its non-descendants NonDesc($X$), given its parents Pa($X$). -->

<!-- This is strong assumption. Typically we must assume that there are hidden, unmeasured confounders that introduce dependencies between variables, which are not depicted in the graph. *It is important to (1) identify known unmeasured confounders and (2) label them on the the causal diagramme. -->

<!-- #### **Faithfulness** -->

<!-- The **Faithfulness** assumption is the inverse of the Causal Markov Condition. It states that if two variables are uncorrelated, it is because there is no direct or indirect causal path between them, not because of any cancelling out of effects. Essentially, it assumes that the relationships in your data are stable and consistent, and will not change if you intervene to change some of the variables. -->

<!-- Formally, if $A$ and $Y$ are independent given a set of variables $L$, then there does not exist a set of edges between $A$ and $Y$ that remains after conditioning on $L$. -->

<!-- As with the *Causal Markov Condition*, *Faithfulness* is a strong assumption, and it might not typically hold in the real world. There could be complex causal structures or interactions that lead to apparent independence between variables, even though they are causally related. -->

Perhaps not all is lost. VanderWeele looks to the theory of multiple versions of treatment for solace.

Recall, a causal effect is defined as the difference in the expected potential outcome when everyone is exposed (perhaps contrary to fact) to one level of a treatment, conditional on their levels of a confounder, with the expected potential outcome when everyone is exposed to a a different level of a treatement (perhaps contrary to fact), conditional on their levels of a counfounder.

$$ \delta = \sum_l \left( \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a,l] - \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a^*,l] \right) P(l)$$

where $\delta$ is the causal estimand on the difference scale $(\mathbb{E}[Y^0 - Y^0])$.

In causal inference, the multiple versions of treatment theory allows us to handle situations where the treatment isn not uniform, but instead has several variations. Each variation or "version" of the treatment can have a different effect on the outcome. However, consistency is not violated because it is redefined: for each version of the treatment, the outcome under that version is equal to the observed outcome when that version is received. Put differently we may think of the indicator $A$ as corresponding to many version of the true treament $K$. Where conditional independence holds such that there is a absence of confounding for the effect of $K$ on $Y$ given $L$, we have: $Y(k)\coprod A|K,L$. This states conditional on $L$, $A$ gives no information about $Y$ once $K$ and $L$ are accounted for. When $Y = Y(k)$ if $K = k$ and Y$(k)$ is independent of $K$, condition on $L$, then $A$ may be thought of as a coarsened indicator of $K$, as shown in @fig_dag_multiple_version_treatment_dag We may estimate consistent causal effects where:

$$ \delta = \sum_{k,l} \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a,l) P(l) - \sum_{k,l} \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a^*,l) P(l)$$

The scenario represents a hypothetical randomised trial where within strata of covariates $L$, individuals in one group receive a treatment $K$ version randomly assigned from the distribution of $K$ distribution $(A = 1, L = l)$ sub-population. Meanwhile, individuals in the other group receive a randomly assigned $K$ version from $(A = 0, L = l)$

This theory finds its utility in scenarios where treatments seldom resemble each other (see: [@vanderweele2013]).

<!-- ### Reflective and formative measurement models may be approached as multiple versions of treatment -->

<!-- Vanderweele applies the following substitution: -->

<!-- $$\delta = \sum_{\eta,l} \mathbb{E}[Y_\eta|l] P(\eta|A=a+1,l) P(l) - \sum_{\eta,l} \mathbb{E}[Y_\eta|l] P(\eta|A=a,l) P(l)$$ -->

<!-- Specifically, we substitue $K$ with $\eta$ from the previous section, and compare the measurement response $A = a + 1$ with $A = a$. We discover that if the influence of $\eta$ on $Y$ is not confounded given $L$, then the multiple versions of reality consistent with the reflective and formative statistical models of reality will not lead to biased estimation. $\delta$ retains its interpretability as a comparison in a hypothetical randomised trial in which the distribution of coarsened measures of $\eta_A$ are balanced within levels of the treatment, conditional on $\eta_L$. -->

<!-- This connection between measurement and the multiple versions of treatment framework provides a hope for consistent causal inference varying reliabilities of measurement. -->

<!-- However, as with the theory of multiple treatments, we might not known how to interpret our results because we don't know the true relationships between our measured indicators and underlying reality. -->
