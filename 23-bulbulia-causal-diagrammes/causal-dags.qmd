title: "How to Build Effective Causal Diagrams (DAGS) for Evolutionary Human Science"
abstract: |
 Causation occurs in time. However, quantifying causal effects requires conceptualising an unobserved counterfactual. Here, I demonstrate the value of aligning a causal diagram's spatial structure with the assumed temporal order of causation. A clear focus on the assumptions required for counterfactual identifiability must also be maintained. Collectively, these strategies substantially enhance a graph's utility, revealing imperatives for data collection and modelling. Part 1 revisits the three fundamental assumptions of causal inferences. Part 2 discusses confounding and uses chronologically ordered causal diagrams to elucidate causal interaction, mediation, and longitudinal growth. Part 3 demonstrates the practical insights time-structured diagrams bring to data collection and modelling. Part 4 applies causal diagrams to selection bias in a three-wave panel, revealing the importance of proper sampling, retention, and handling of missing data. Finally, Part 5 employs chronologically ordered causal diagrams to discuss threats to causal estimation from measurement error, with applications for comparative cultural research and the interpretation of latent factor constructs.

## Introduction

Correlation is not causation. However, persistent confusion in the analysis and reporting of correlations has limited scientific progress across many human sciences. The direction of causation frequently runs opposite to the direction of manifest correlations. This problem is widely known. Nevertheless, many human scientists report manifest correlations using hedging language. Making matters worse, widely adopted strategies for confounding control fail [@mcelreath2020], suggesting a "causality crisis" [@bulbulia2022]. Addressing the causality crisis is among the human science's most pressing tasks.

When integrated into methodologically rigorous workflows, causal Directed Acyclic Graphs ("DAGs" or "causal diagrams") can be powerful tools for clarifying causality.[^1] A system of formal mathematical proofs underpins their design. This quality brings confidence. No formal mathematical training is required to use them. This quality makes them accessible. However, causal inference relies on assumptions. Causal diagrams are methods for encoding such assumptions. Where assumptions are unwarranted, causal diagrams may deceive. For example, when researchers lack time-series data, causal effect estimates are generally unwarranted: causal diagrams should not be used. Ideally, however, causal diagrams would serve as circuit breakers that halt such misapplications.

[^1]: The term "DAG" is somewhat misleading because not all directed acyclic graphs represent causal structures. For a graph to embody a causal structure, it must satisfy the conditions of the Markov factorisation property (see: Part 2).

Here, I introduce a suite of techniques for constructing causal diagrams that improve their utility. The core of this advice is to develop *chronologically ordered causal diagrams* -- that is, causal diagrams in which the temporal order of cause and effect is evident in the graph's spatial layout and its labelling of the nodes. I then illustrate the application of chronologically ordered causal diagrams for research design in evolutionary human science.

There are many excellent introductions to causal diagrams [@rohrer2018; @hernán2023; @cinelli2022; @barrett2021; @mcelreath2020; @greenland1999; @suzuki2020; @pearl2009].[^2] One may reasonably ask whether another introduction adds clutter. The approach I present here hopes to add value in five ways.

[^2]: An excellent resource is Miguel Hernan's free online course, here: <https://pll.harvard.edu/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-your-conclusions>.

**Part 1** introduces the counterfactual framework for causal inference as the appropriate theoretical setting for developing causal diagrams. Here, I review the three fundamental identification assumptions required for causal inference.

**Part 2** discusses the four primary forms of confounding. Here, I introduce chronologically ordered causal diagrams. I explain how temporal ordering brings clarity and direction to data collection and modelling. I explain how chronologically ordered causal diagrams illuminate the topics of causal interaction, causal mediation, and longitudinal growth modelling in settings of treatment-confounder feedback.

**Part 3** discusses the advantages of collecting repeated measures data for at least three waves, benefits that chronologically ordered causal diagrams make evident. This discussion of the three-wave panel provides practical guidance for human evolutionary scientists interested in recording history, as it is occurring in the present, to obtain a quantitative causal understanding for their questions.

**Part 4** discusses selection bias in a three-wave panel. Here, I use chronologically ordered causal diagrams to demonstrate the mission-critical importance for causal estimation of adequate sampling and longitudinal retention.

**Part 5** uses causal diagrams to clarify four types of measurement bias that arise when addressing causal questions. This section will particularly interest researchers in comparative cultural research, and researchers who employ composite scales.

Throughout this study, it is the application of chronologically ordered causal diagrams in the setting of counterfactual data science that illuminates both effective research strategies and their limitations.

## Part 1. The Three Fundamental Identifiability Assumptions of Causal Inference

Before we can answer causal questions, we must understand how to ask them [@hernán2016]. In this section I review the three fundamental identification assumptions required for causal inference.

### The fundamental problem of causal inference

We are entitled to claim that $A$ causes $Y$ if altering $A$ would have influenced the outcome of $Y$ [@hume1902; @lewis1973]. This claim requires counterfactual reasoning. The causal effect is conceived as a contrast between the world as it is, and the world as it could have been. Our objective in causal inference is to quantify the magnitude of such contrasts.

Suppose we observe a correlation between cultural beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity. Suppose further that we seek to quantify the magnitude of the causal effect of such beliefs. Denote beliefs in Big Gods, the "exposure" or "treatment," by $A$. Denote social complexity, the outcome, by $Y$. For now, assume the exposure, outcome, and the units on which the exposures and outcomes are measured, "cultures," are well-defined. (We will revisit these assumptions shortly.)

The causal effect of belief in Big Gods on social complexity in culture $i$ is defined as the difference between two potential outcomes, $Y_i(a)$ under distinct exposure levels $a$. Here, $A_i = 1$ denotes the presence of belief in Big Gods and $A_i = 0$ denotes its absence, and $Y_i(a)$ denotes the potential social complexity under exposure level $A = a$. The causal contrast on the difference scale may be expressed

$$
\text{Causal Effect of Belief in Big Gods}_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) 
$$

To evaluate causality for any individual culture, we must establish two counterfactual or "potential" outcomes:

-   $Y_i(a = 1)$: The social complexity of culture $i$ under belief in Big Gods. This outcome is counterfactual for each culture where $A_i = 0$.
-   $Y_i(a = 0)$: The social complexity of culture $i$ without belief in Big Gods. This outcome is counterfactual for each culture where $A_i = 1$.[^3]

[^3]: The counterfactual outcome under exposure $A = a$ can be denoted in several ways, such as $Y(a)$, $Y^{a}$, and $Y_a$, with $Y(a)$ being our chosen notation. For simplicity, we assume the exposures are exhaustive.



To determine causality, then, we require a contrast between two states of the world, one of which is inevitably counterfactual. Each individual causal effect is not identified in the data. This is known as "the fundamental problem of causal inference" [@rubin1976; @holland1986]. Inferring counterfactual contrasts -- which is required for quantitative causal estimates -- thus becomes a special, elusive, *missing data problem* [@westreich2015; @edwards2015].

#### Causal inference is an approach for estimating average (marginal) causal effects

Individual-level causal effects are typically unobservable. However, under certain conditions we may use observable data to estimate average causal effects between exposure conditions when certain assumptions are satisfied. To obtain these effects on the difference scale, we must compute a difference in average outcomes (or equivalently, the average of the differences in outcomes) from units exposed to different treatment levels. In the case of a binary exposure, this contrast is between the average difference (or equivalently, the difference of the averages) when (1) all units are exposed to a certain level of treatment and (2) none are exposed.[^4]

[^4]: Note that the difference in average expectations is equivalent to the average of the differences in expectations.

On the difference scale, where $a$ and $a^*$ denote different levels of treatment, this average treatment effect (ATE) is given by the expression

$$
ATE = E[Y(a)] - E[Y(a^*)]
$$

However, we have just said that each unit may receive only one level of the exposure, $A_i = a$ or $A_i = a^*$, and that as such individual-level causal effects are generally not identifiable. Because the treatment groups are composed of individual units, the treatment groups will also contain missing observations. Where $\delta$ denotes the average treatment effect, the problem can be expressed

$$
\delta = \underbrace{\big(E[Y(1)|A = 1]\big)}_{\text{observed}} + \underbrace{\big(E[Y(1)|A = 0]\big)}_{\text{unobserved}} - \underbrace{\big(E[Y(0)|A = 0]\big)}_{\text{observed}}  - \underbrace{\big(E[Y(0)|A = 1]\big)}_{\text{unobserved}}
$$

Causal inference is a framework of assumptions and methods for deriving causal contrasts from observed or observable data. This is why we may call it *counterfactual data science.* To effectively use causal diagrams, it is essential to comprehend their role within this broader framework.

### Identification Assumption 1: Causal Consistency

The causal consistency assumption plays a pivotal role in addressing that special, elusive, *missing data problem* at the foundation of each causal question. Let $Y_i^{observed}|A_i$ denote an individual's observed outcome in response to treatment. Where the causal consistency assumption is satisfied, we may derive counterfactual outcomes from the following rule:

$$
Y_i^{observed}|A = 
\begin{cases} 
Y_i(~a^*) & \text{if } A_i = a* \\
Y_i(~a~) & \text{if } A_i = a
\end{cases}
$$

Where the causal consistency assumption is satisfied, we can state that the observed outcome, given an individual's actual exposure, matches that individual's counterfactual outcome under the same exposure. Although this equivalence provides up to half of the counterfactual outcomes required to compute causal contrasts. When met, the counterfactual consistency assumption provides this essential connection bridges from observed outcomes to counterfactual outcomes. Although this bridge only takes us halfway to acquiring the full range of counterfactual outcomes needed to identify average treatment effects, it marks a significant beginning.

**The no interference assumption**: This assumption requiers that the exposure status of each unit in the study does not influence the outcome of another unit. Let $i$ represent a specific unit. Let $a_i$ and $a'_i$ denote two potential exposure statuses for this unit. Let $j$ denote another unit, where $a_j'$ differs from $a_j$, indicating an alternative potential exposure status for unit $j$. 

The no interference assumption requires that the potential outcome for unit $i$ under treatment $a_i$ is not influenced by the exposure assignment of any other unit $j$, expressed 

$$
Y_i(a_i, a_j') = Y_i(a_i, a'_j), \quad \forall a_i, a'_j,
$$

In this equation, $Y_i$ denotes the potential outcome for unit $i$.  The equivalence implies that this potential outcomes remains invariant irrespective of the exposure status of another unit $j$.

Hence, if the exposure assignment for any unit $j$ ($A=a_j$ or $A=a'_j$) does not influence the potential outcome of unit $i$ when $A=a_i$, the potential outcome for unit $i$ under treatment $a_i$ satisfies the no interference assumption. 

The no interference assumption (also known as the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)), can be violated when there are social network effects. For instance, the efficacy of a vaccine may depend on the vaccination rate in the population [@ogburn2022; @murray2021; @murray2021a]




**The theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment derives from a proof that the causal consistency assumption does not strictly require homogeneity of treatment administrations*. the "treatment variation irrelevance" that we require to assume causal consistency can be difficult to assess in practice because treatment versions in our observational data may not be well-defined. VanderWeele proved that under the theory of causal inference under multiple exposures, where there are $K$ different versions of treatment $A$, we may consistently estimate causal effects under the assumptions of "treatment variation irrelevance" [@vanderweele2009]. More specifically, we may claim such an entitlement to the causal consistency assumption if the effects of the variations of the treatment are independent of the counterfactual outcomes under such treatments, that is, if there is no confounding for $K$'s effect on $Y$ given measured confounders $L$ such that

$$
K \coprod Y(k) | L
$$

or equivalently

$$
Y(k) \coprod K | L
$$

According to the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment, the measured variable $A$ functions as a "coarsened indicator" for estimating the causal effect of the multiple versions of treatment $K$ on $Y(k)$ [@vanderweele2009; @vanderweele2013; @vanderweele2018]. (See Appendix 1 for additional discussion of the proof and its implications.) (see: [@hernán2022a; @murray2021a; @hernán2008; @bulbulia2022].[^5]

[^5]: see Appendix 1 for a more detailed explanation of the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment.

**The theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment**:
Building on these foundational assumptions in causal inference, we encounter more complex situation. Consider that in observational research there are typically multiple versions of a given treatment. The theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment emerges from a proof showing that the causal consistency assumption does not strictly require homogeneity in the administration of treatments. VanderWeele demonstrated that under a theory of causal inference under multiple exposures, where there are $K$ different versions of treatment $A$, we can estimate causal effects consistently under the assumptions of "treatment variation irrelevance" [@vanderweele2009, @vanderweele2009; @vanderweele2013; @vanderweele2018] (See Appendix 1 for additional discussion of the proof and its implications.)

**The theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment has limited application**: the "treatment variation irrelevance" that we require to assume causal consistency can be difficult to assess in practice because the $K$ treatment versions in our data may not be well-defined. This is important because to assess the conditional independence assumption (described below) we must understand the set of interventions upon which the units of treatment are meant to be exchangeable. When defining treatments and outcomes for estimating causal effects, we must clearly state the hypothetical interventions and specific outcomes to which they apply. In practice, the symbol $K$ m️ight denote little more than our ignorance. I will return to this topic in Part 4 (see: [@hernán2022a; @murray2021a; @hernán2008; @bulbulia2022]).[^5]

[^5]: see Appendix 1 for a more detailed explanation of the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment.

### Identification Assumption 2: (Conditional) Exchangeability

The (conditional) exchangeability assumption refers to the treatment assignment mechanism. It holds if, upon conditioning on observed covariates, the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes under treatment. Conceptually, assuming both causal consistency (including SUTVA) and positivity are satisfied, exchangeability implies that if units were swapped between treatment conditions, the distribution of potential outcomes under different exposures would remain unchanged. This assumption is needed to ensure a balance between exposures in confounders that might affect the outcome. With this assumption satisfied, the counterfactual observations derived from the consistency and positivity assumptions can be viewed as randomly assigned to the exposure conditions under which they were observed. In effect (as it were), satisfying the conditional exchangeability assumption is an attempt to simulate experimentally controlled randomisation with observational data.

Let $L$ to be the set of measured covariates required to ensure conditional independence. Let $\coprod$ denote independence. We express the exchangeability of counterfactual outcomes conditional on measured covariates $L$ as

$$
Y(a) \coprod  A|L \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad A \coprod  Y(a)|L
$$

Where the exchangeability assumption holds, along with the consistency and positivity assumptions, we may express the average treatment effect (ATE) on the difference scale

$$
ATE = E[Y(a^*)|L = l] - E[Y(a)|L = l]
$$

**It is important to understand that causal diagrams were developed to evaluate the conditional exchangeability assumption.** Although causal diagrams can be helpful for assessing the causal consistency assumption and the positivity assumption (no deterministic arrows), their primary utility lies in clarifying the requirements of conditional exchangeability [@hernán2023]. Keeping this primary function in mind helps to avoid misapplications of the tool, such as interpreting (so-called) structural equation models as causal diagrams, or attempting to represent non-linear relationships in the graph. (We will revisit these potential misuses later.)

### Identification Assumption 3: Positivity

The positivity assumption is satisfied if there is a non-zero probability of receiving or not receiving the exposure within each level of all covariates. In other words, within every stratum of every covariate, the probability of each exposure value must be greater than zero. Mathematically:

$$
0 < \Pr(A=a|L)<1, ~ \forall a \in A, ~ \forall l \in L
$$

Causal inference encounters challenges without the satisfaction of the positivity assumption, as the envisioning of causal contrasts hinges on the potential for randomised assignment to interventions [@westreich2010].

There are two types of positivity violations.

1.  **Random non-positivity**: this refers to situations where the exposure is conceivable, yet some potential observations, while theoretically possible, are absent within our data. This situation often arises with continuous exposures, where certain realisations along the number line are naturally missing due to its infinite nature. Despite this, it remains possible to employ statistical models to estimate causal contrasts. Notably, random non-positivity is the only identifiability assumption that can be checked using data.

2.  **Deterministic non-positivity:** this refers to situations where the exposures are impossible or inconceivable. A classical example is the impossibility of a hysterectomy in biological males.

### The difficulty of satisfying the three fundamental assumptions of causal inference when asking causal questions of history

Consider the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, which initiated religious change throughout much of Europe. Historians have variously argued that Protestantism caused social, cultural, and economic changes in those societies where it took hold (see: [@weber1905; @weber1993; @swanson1967; @swanson1971; @basten2013], for an overview see: [@becker2016]).

Suppose we are interested in estimating the "Average Treatment Effect" of the Protestant Reformation. Let $A = a^*$ denote the adoption of Protestantism. We compare this effect with that of remaining Catholic, represented as $A = a$. We assume that both the concepts of "adopting Protestantism" and of "economic development" are well-defined (e.g. GDP +1 century after a country has a Protestant majority contrasted with remaining Catholic). The causal effect for any individual country is $Y_i(a^*) - Y_i(a)$. Although we cannot identify this effect, if the basic assumptions of causal inference are met, we can estimate the average or marginal effect as

$$\frac{1}{n} \left[\sum_i^{n} Y_i(a^*) - \sum_i^{n} Y_i(a)\right],$$

which, conditioning the confounding effects of $L$ gives us

$$ATE_{\textnormal{economic~development}} = E[Y(\textnormal{Became~Protestant}|L) - Y(\textnormal{Remained~Catholic}|L)]$$

When asking the question about the economic effect of adopting Protestantism versus remaining Catholic, there are indeed several challenges that arise in relation to the three fundamental assumptions required for causal inference.

**Causal Consistency**: This assumption implies that the outcome under each level of exposure is well-defined. In this context, defining what "adopting Protestantism" and "remaining Catholic" mean may present challenges. The practices and beliefs associated with each religion might vary significantly across countries and time periods, and it may be difficult to create a consistent, well-defined exposure. Furthermore, the outcome - economic development - may also be challenging to measure consistently across different countries and time periods.

There is undoubtedly considerable heterogeneity in the "Protestant exposure." In England, Protestantism was closely tied to the monarchy [@collinson2007]. In Germany, Martin Luther's teachings emphasised individual faith in scripture, which, it has been claimed, supported economic development by promoting literacy [@gawthrop1984]. In England, King Henry VIII abolished Catholicism [@collinson2007]. The Reformation, then, occurred differently in different places. The exposure needs to be better-defined.

There is also ample scope for interference: 16th century societies were interconnected through trade, diplomacy, and warfare. Thus, the religious decisions of one society were unlikely to have been independent from those of other societies.

**Exchangeability**: this assumption implies that given the confounders, the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment assignment. It might be difficult to account for all possible confounders in this context. For example, historical, political, social, and geographical factors could influence both a country's religious affiliations and its economic development. If these factors are not properly controlled, it could lead to confounding bias.

**Positivity**:tThis assumption requires that there is a non-zero probability of every level of exposure for every strata of confounders. If we consider various confounding factors such as geographical location, historical events, or political circumstances, some countries might only ever have the possibility of either remaining Catholic or becoming Protestant, but not both. For example, it is unclear under which conditions 16th century Spain could have been randomly assigned to Protestantism [@nalle1987].

Perhaps a more credible measure of effect in the region of our interests is the Average Treatment Effect in the Treated (ATT) expressed

$$ATT_{\textnormal{economic~development}} = E[(Y(a*)- Y(a))|A = a*,L]$$

Here, the ATT defines the expected difference in economic success for cultures that became Protestant compared with the expected economic success if those cultures had not become Protestant, conditional on measured confounders $L$, among the exposed ($A = a^*$). To estimate this contrast, our models would need to match Protestant cultures with comparable Catholic cultures effectively. By estimating the ATT, we would avoid the assumption of non-deterministic positivity for the untreated. However, whether matching is conceptually plausible remains for historians and philosophers. It would seem that assigning a religion to a culture a religion is not as easy as administering a pill [@watts2018].

### Summary Part 1

To quantify causal effects requires converting observations into causal contrasts. Causation itself, however, is never directly observed. Obtaining causal contrasts from data requires assumptions. The three fundamental assumptions of causal inference are:

1.  **Causal Consistency**: the exposure under comparison relate to well-defined interventions found in the data [@hernán2023] (see also: @chatton2020).

2.  **Exchangeability**: after adjusted for measured covariates, the potential outcomes under all exposure levels are independent of the actual exposure level received [@hernán2023].

3.  **Positivity:** the probability of receiving every exposure value within all strata of covariates exceeds zero [@hernán2023].

Causal diagrams predominantly assist in evaluating the (conditional) exchangeability assumption, an integral component of the counterfactual data science framework. This assumption forms part of a more comprehensive framework of counterfactual data science, a science that is concerned with deriving insights from marginal contrasts of hypothetical scenarios from from partial observations.  *If positivity is satisfied, the counterfactual consistency assumption yields half of the required counterfactual outcomes for inferring causal contrasts. Exchangeability supplies the remaining half.*

## Part 2. Chronologically Ordered Causal Diagrams

### Background: Concepts and Conventions

Causal diagrams, in their contemporary form, were developed by Judea Pearl. Their purpose is to assist researchers in identifying the conditions under which causal effects can be discerned from data [@pearl1995; @pearl2009; @greenland1999].

To use causal diagrams, we must understand the following concepts and conventions:

1.  **Nodes and edges**: nodes represent variables or events within a causal system, while edges signify relationships or interactions between these variables.

2.  **Directed and undirected edges**: directed edges, depicted as arrows, signify an assumed causal link from one variable to another. In contrast, undirected edges, which lack arrows, signify an assumed association exists but no direct causal link is implied. These edges in a causal diagram indicate potential avenues of influence between nodes.

3.  **Ancestors and descendants**: we call a variable an "ancestor" if it directly or indirectly influences another variable. Conversely, we call a variable a "descendant" if it is influenced, directly or indirectly, by another variable.

4.  **D-separation**: we call a path "blocked", or "d-separated", if a node along it prevents the transmission of influence. Two variables are considered d-separated if all paths between them are blocked; otherwise, they are d-connected [@pearl1995].

Pearl showed that the principles of d-separation enable us to evaluate relationships between nodes in a causal diagram (also known as a "Directed Acyclic Graph" or a "causal DAG") [@pearl1995].

The rules of d-separation:

a.  **Chain rule**: in a chain structure, where three variables are connected sequentially (represented as $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$), conditioning on $B$ d-separates $A$ and $C$.

b.  **Fork rule**: in a fork structure, where $B$ is a common cause of both $A$ and $C$ (represented as $A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C$), conditioning on $B$ d-separates $A$ and $C$.

c.  **Collider rule**: in a collider structure, where $B$ is a common effect of both $A$ and $C$ (represented as $A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C$), $B$ d-separates $A$ and $C$ only if neither $B$ nor any of $B$'s descendants are conditioned upon.

In each case, if $B$ does not d-separate $A$ and $C$, $A$ and $C$ are considered to be d-connected given $B$. This suggests an open path between $A$ and $C$. If all paths between $A$ and $C$ are blocked, or equivalently, if no path remains open, then $A$ and $C$ are d-separated given a set of conditioning variables [@pearl2009].

The rules of d-separation clarify which variables to adjust for when estimating causal effects: we seek a set of variables that d-separates the exposure from the outcome. By conditioning on such an adjustment set, we block all confounding paths, leaving only the causal effect [@pearl2009].

5.  **Adjustment set**: a collection of variables that we either condition upon or deliberately avoid conditioning upon to block all backdoor paths between the exposure and the outcome in the causal diagram [@pearl2009].

6.  **Confounders**: a member of an adjustment set. Importantly, *we call a variable as a "confounder" in relation to a specific adjustment set.*

7.  **Control of confounding by the Modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion**: VanderWeele's Modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion provides practical guidance for controlling for confounding [@vanderweele2019]. According to this criterion, a member of any set of variables that can reduce or remove the bias caused by confounding is deemed a member of this confounder set. VanderWeele's strategy for defining a confounder set is as follows:

<!-- -->

a.  Control for any variable that causes the exposure, the outcome, or both.
b.  Control for any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a shared cause of both exposure and outcome.
c.  Define an instrumental variable as a variable associated with the exposure but does not influence the outcome independently, except through the exposure. Exclude any instrumental variable that is not a proxy for an unmeasured confounder from the confounder set.

Note that the concept of a "confounder set" is broader than the concept of an "adjustment set." Every adjustment set is a member of a confounder set. So the Modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion will eliminate confounding when the data permit. However a confounder set includes variables that will reduce confounding in cases where confounding cannot be eliminated. Confounding can almost never be elimiated with certainty. For this reason we must perform sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of our results. These results will be less dependent on sensitivity analysis if we can reduce confounding. For this reason, I follow those who recommend using the Modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion for confounding control. Here, when focussing on strategies for attenuated confounding that cannot be fully controlled, I use dotted black directed edges to indicate attenuated confounding, and a blue directed edge to denote the association between the exposure and the outcome.[^note_allconfound] 

[^note_allconfound]: Nearly every plausible scenario involving causal inference with observational data and non-random exposures presents a risk of unmeasured confounding. However, I refrain from universally applying this visualisation strategy to each graph to maintain focus on the specific issue each graph represents.

8.  **Compatibility**: the joint distribution of the variables is said to be compatible with the graph if it upholds the conditional independencies the graph implies [@pearl2009a].

9.  **Faithfulness**: a graph is said to be faithful if the conditional independencies found in the data are reflected in the graph, and conversely, if the dependencies suggested by the graph can be observed in the data [@pearl1995a].[^6]

[^6]: Although the assumption of faithfulness or "weak faithfulness" allows for the possibility that some of the independences in the data might occur by coincidence (i.e., because of a cancellation of different effects), the assumption of strong faithfulness does not. The strong faithfulness condition assumes that the observed data's statistical relationships directly reflect the underlying causal structure, with no independence relationships arising purely by coincidental cancellations. This is a stronger assumption than (weak) faithfulness and is often more practical in real-world applications of causal inference. Note that the faithfulness assumption (whether weak or strong) is not testable by observed data -- it is an assumption about the relationship between the observed data and the underlying causal structure.

<!-- 10. **Markov Factorisation**: relates graph structure to joint probability distributions of the represented variables. Given a causal diagram with nodes corresponding to variables $X = (X_1, ..., X_n)$, the joint distribution $P(X)$ factorises according to the graph if expressed as a product of conditional distributions for each node given its direct parents. Mathematically: $P(X) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | \text{pa}_G(X_i))$, where $\text{pa}_G(X_i)$ are the parent nodes of $X_i$ in graph $G$. The principle of Markov factorisation bridges the structure of the causal diagram and the joint probability distribution of the variables. It allows complex multivariate distributions to be broken down into simpler conditional ones. It does this by demonstrating that each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parents [@lauritzen1990; @pearl1988]. Causal diagrams are powerful because they allow us to take in this complexity at a glance. -->

10. **Markov factorisation**: pertains to the relationship between the structure of a causal diagram and the distribution of variables it represents. Essentially, Markov factorisation allows us to express the joint distribution of all variables as a product of simpler, conditional distributions. According to this principle, each variable in the diagram depends directly only on its parent variables and is independent of others. This simplification allows us to graphically represent complex relationships between multiple variables in a causal system [@lauritzen1990; @pearl1988]. Causal diagrams are powerful because under their hood is the engine of Markov factorisation.

11. **Backdoor criterion**: a set of conditions under which the effect of a treatment on an outcome can be obtained by controlling for a specific set of variables. The backdoor criterion guides the selection of **adjustment sets** [@pearl1995].[^7]

[^7]: Note there is also a Front-Door Criterion, which provides another way to estimate causal effects, even in the presence of unmeasured confounding variables. It relies on identifying a variable (or set of variables) that mediates the entire effect of the treatment on the outcome. The front-door criterion is rarely used in practice.

<!-- -->

12. **Identification problem**: the challenge of estimating the causal effect of a variable using observed data. Causal diagrams were developed to address the identification problem.

13. **Acyclic**: Causal diagrams must be acyclic -- they cannot contain feedback loops. More precisely: no variable can be an ancestor or descendant of itself. *Therefore, in cases where repeated measurements are taken, nodes must be indexed by time.* As mentioned, repeated measures time series data are almost always required to estimate causal effects quantitatively. In Part 3 we consider how adding baseline measures of the outcome and exposure in a three-wave repeated measures design greatly enhances causal estimation [@pearl2009]. To represent the nodes of this design on a graph we must index them by time because the nodes are repeated.

14. **Total, direct and indirect effects**: in the presence of mediating variables, it is helpful to differentiate the total effect (the overall effect of a variable $A$ on an outcome $Y$), direct effect (the effect of $A$ on $Y$ not via any mediator), and indirect effect (the effect of $A$ on $Y$ via mediator). We consider the assumptions of causal mediation below [@vanderweele2015].

15. **Time-varying confounding:** this occurs when a confounder that changes over time also acts as a mediator in the causal pathway between exposure and outcome. Controlling for such a confounder can introduce bias. G-methods, a set of longitudinal methods, are typically utilised to address time-varying confounding. We discuss time-varying confounding at the end of Part 2 [@hernán2023].

<!-- 16. **Statistical Model:** A statistical model is a mathematical formulation that captures the relationships between observable or latent variables. It establishes a framework that quantifies how changes in one variable correspond with changes in others. For instance, in Part 5, we discuss the **reflective latent factor model**. This model posits that observable variables (indicators) are derived from or influenced by an unobserved (latent) variable. The relationship is typically expressed as $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$, where $X_i$ is an observed variable, $\eta$ is the latent variable, $\lambda_i$ is the factor loading of the $i$th indicator, and $\varepsilon_i$ is the error term. Statistical models such as the reflective latent factors models may be equivalent to multiple causal structures [@wright1920; @wright1923; @pearl2018; @hernán2023]. -->

16. **Statistical model:** a statistical model is a mathematical representation of the relationships between variables. It provides a framework to quantify how changes in one variable correspond with changes in others. For example, in Part 5 we discuss the **reflective latent factor model** in Part 5. This model posits that observable variables, or indicators, are influenced by an unobserved or latent variable. The relationship is typically expressed in a simplified form where each observed variable is a product of a "factor loading" and the latent variable, plus an error term. Importantly, **statistical models like the reflective latent factor model can correspond to multiple causal structures** [@wright1920; @wright1923; @pearl2018; @hernán2023].

17. **Structural model:** a structural model goes beyond a statistical model by integrating assumptions about causal relationships. Although statistical models capture relationships among variables, inferring causal relationships necessitates additional assumptions or information. Causal diagrams serve to graphically encode these assumptions, effectively representing the structural model [@hernán2023].

**What is the distinction between statistical and structural models?** Statistical models capture relationships, focusing on the question "how much?". Conversely, structural models address "what if?" questions by describing the requirements to infer causation. Importantly, a correlation identified by a statistical model does not imply a causal relationship. Thus, a structural model is needed to interpret the statistical findings in causal terms.

#### **Variable Naming Conventions**

**Outcome**. Denoted by $Y$ below. To ask a causal question, the outcome, or "effect," must be clearly defined. For instance, rather than stating "the causal effect of the Protestant Reformation on economic success," specify "the +100 year effect on adjusted GDP after a country transitioned to a Protestant majority." This clarity reveals limitations or challenges of causal inference, such as conceptual incoherence, irrelevance, or data deficiencies.

**Exposure or treatment**. Denoted by $A$ below. To ask a causal question, the exposure (or "treatment") also needs to be clearly defined. And it should not violate the positivity assumption. Understanding the intervention enables accurate assessment of potential outcome variations under different interventions.

**Measured confounders**. Denoted by $L$ below. These are variables that, when part of a sufficient adjustment set, can reduce or eliminate the non-causal association between exposure $A$ and outcome $Y$.

**Unmeasured confounders**. Denoted by $U$ below. These are confounding variables that remain unmeasured and may hinder the d-separation of exposure and outcome. Unmeasured confounders may bias causal estimates by creating spurious relationships between the exposure and outcome.

### Elemental counfounds

Four fundamental confounding types exist, as outlined by @mcelreath2020 p.185. Next, we consider the benefits of expressing chronology in the spatial organisation of a causal diagrams.

### 1. The problem of confounding by a common cause

The problem of confounding by common cause arises when there is a variable, denoted by $L$ that influences both the exposure, denoted by $A$ and the outcome, denoted by $Y.$ Because $L$ is a common cause of $A$ and $Y$, $L$ may create a statistical association between $A$ and $Y$ that does not reflect a causal association. For example, people who smoke are more likely to have yellow fingers. Suppose smoking causes cancer. Because smoking ($L$) is a common cause of yellow fingers ($A$) and cancer ($Y$), $A$ and $Y$ will be associated in the data. However, intervening to change the colour of a person's fingers would not affect cancer. @fig-dag-common-cause presents a scenario in which the association of $A$ and $Y$ in the data is confounded by the common cause $L$. The dashed red arrow in the graph indicates the bias arising from the open backdoor path from $A$ to $Y$ arising from their common cause $L$.

\draw [-latex, black] (L) to (A);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of all measured variables

Addressing confounding by a common cause involves its adjustment. This adjustment effectively closes the backdoor path from the exposure to the outcome. Equivalently, conditioning on $L$ d-separates $A$ and $Y$. Common adjustment methods include regression, matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and G-methods (covered in [@hernán2023a]). @fig-dag-common-cause-solution clarifies that any confounder that is a common cause of both $A$ and $Y$ must precede $A$ (and hence $Y$), since effects follow their causes chronologically.

By time-indexing the nodes on the graph, we see that **control of confounding generally necessitates time-series data.**

```

### 2. Confounding by collider stratification (conditioning on a common effect)

Conditioning on a common effect occurs when a variable $L$ is affected by the treatment $A$ and an outcome $Y$.

Suppose $A$ and $Y$ are initially independent, such that $A \coprod Y(a)$. Conditioning on the joint effect $L$ opens a backdoor path between $A$ and $Y$, potentially inducing a non-causal association. This occurs because $L$ can provide information about both $A$ and $Y$.

To clarify this confounding, let $A$ denote the level of belief in Big Gods (with higher values indicating stronger belief), $Y$ denote social complexity, and $L$ denote economic trade. Suppose that belief in Big Gods and social complexity are not causally linked. That is, if we were to intervene to foster such beliefs, this intervention would not itself make a difference to whether a society develops social complexity. However, suppose beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity each influence levels of economic trade ($L$). Now suppose we were to condition on economic trade without attending to temporal order -- perhaps because time series data are not available. In that case, we could find a statistical association between belief in Big Gods and social complexity without a causal association.[^8]

[^8]: To clarify, denote the observed associations as follows:

    -   $P(A)$: Distribution of beliefs in Big Gods
    -   $P(Y)$: Distribution of social complexity
    -   $P(L)$: Distribution of economic trade

    Without conditioning on $L$, if $A$ and $Y$ are independent, we have:

    $$P(A, Y) = P(A)P(Y)$$

    However, if we condition on $L$ (which is a common effect of both $A$ and $Y$), we have:

    $$P(A, Y | L) \neq P(A | L)P(Y | L)$$

    Once conditioned on, the common effect $L$ creates an association between $A$ and $Y$ that is not causal. This association in the data can mislead us into believing there is a direct link between beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity, even without such a link. If we only observed $A$, $Y$, and $L$ in cross-sectional data, we might erroneously conclude $A \to Y$

    When $A$ and $Y$ are independent, the joint probability of $A$ and $Y$ is equal to the product of their individual probabilities: $P(A, Y) = P(A)P(Y)$. However, when we condition on $L$, the joint probability of $A$ and $Y$ given $L$ is not necessarily equal to the product of the individual probabilities of $A$ and $Y$ given $L$, hence the inequality $P(A, Y | L) \neq P(A | L)P(Y | L)$.

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of all measured variables

To address the problem of conditioning on a common effect, we should *generally* ensure that:

1.  all confounders $L$ that are common causes of the exposure $A$ and the outcome $Y$ are measured before $A$ has occurred, and
2.  $A$ is measured before $Y$ has occurred.

If such temporal order is preserved, $L$ cannot be an effect of $A$, and thus neither of $Y$.[^9] In the example just described for beliefs and social complexity, such assurance typically requires time-series data with accurate measurements. Also required is a sufficiently large sample of cultures that transition in religious beliefs, with measurements of social complexity before and after. Moreover, the cultures in the dataset would need to be independent of each other.[^10]

[^9]: This rule is not absolute. As indicated in @fig-dag-descendent-solution, it may be helpful in certain circumstances to condition on a confounder that occurs after the outcome has occurred.

[^10]: The independence of cultural units was at the centre of the study of comparative urban archaeology from the late 19th [@decoulanges1903] through the late 20th century [@wheatley1971]. Despite attention to this problem in recent work (e.g. [@watts2016]), there is arguably a greater head-room for understanding the need for conditional independence of cultures in recent cultural evolutionary studies. Again, attending to the temporal order of events is essential.

### M-bias: conditioning on a collider that occurs before the exposure may introduce bias

Typically, indicators for confounders should be included only if they are known to be measured before their exposures ( exceptions described below).

However, researchers should also be cautious about over-conditioning on pre-exposure variables that are not associated with both the exposure and confounder, as doing so can induce confounding. As shown in @fig-m-bias, collider stratification may arise even if $L$ occurs before $A$. This happens when $L$ does not affect $A$ or $Y$, but may be the descendent of an unmeasured variable that affects $A$ and another unmeasured variable that also affects $Y$. Conditioning on $L$ in this scenario evokes "M-bias." If $L$ is not a common cause of $A$ and $Y$, or the effect of a shared common cause, $L$ should not be included in a causal model. @fig-m-bias presents a case in which $A \coprod Y(a)$ but $A \cancel{\coprod} Y(a)| L$. M-bias is another example of collider stratification bias (see: [@cole2010]).

\draw [-latex,  draw=red, red, dashed] (A) to (Y);


\end{tikzpicture}
```

### Advice: adopt the modified disjunctive cause criterion for confounding control

Again, the modified disjunctive cause criterion will satisfy the backdoor criterion in all cases and reduce bias where this criterion cannot be fully satisfied. Again:

a.  Control for any variable that causes the exposure, the outcome, or both.
b.  Control for any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a shared cause of both exposure and outcome.
c.  Define an instrumental variable as a variable associated with the exposure but does not influence the outcome independently, except through the exposure. Exclude any instrumental variable that is not a proxy for an unmeasured confounder from the confounder set (see: @vanderweele2020 page 441, [@vanderweele2019])

Of course, the difficulty is in determining which variables belong to the desired set. Specialist knowledge can facilitate this task. However, this determination cannot generally be made from the data.

### 3. Mediator bias

Conditioning on a mediator -- a variable that lies along the causal pathway between the treatment and the outcome -- can distort the total effect of the treatment on the outcome and potentially introduce bias. To illustrate this, consider "beliefs in Big Gods" as the treatment ($A$), "social complexity" as the outcome ($Y$), and "economic trade" as the mediator ($L$).

In this scenario, the belief in Big Gods ($A$) has a direct impact on economic trade ($L$), which subsequently influences social complexity ($Y$). If we condition on economic trade ($L$), we could bias our estimates of the overall effect of beliefs in Big Gods ($A$) on social complexity ($Y$). This bias happens because conditioning on $L$ can downplay the direct effect of $A$ on $Y$, as it blocks the indirect path through $L$. This problem, known as mediator bias, is illustrated in @fig-dag-mediator.

We might think that conditioning on a mediator does not introduce bias under a null hypothesis ($A$ does not cause $Y$), however, this is not the case. Consider a situation where $L$ is a common effect of the exposure $A$ and an unmeasured variable $U$ linked to the outcome $Y$. In this scenario, including $L$ may amplify the association between $A$ and $Y$, even if $A$ is not associated with $Y$ and $U$ does not cause $A$. This scenario is represented in @fig-dag-descendent.

So, unless one is explicitly investigating mediation analysis, it is usually not advisable to condition on a post-treatment variable. Again, attending to chronology in the the spatial organisation of the graph reveals an imperative for data collection: if we cannot ensure that $L$ is measured before $A$, and if $A$ may affect $L$, including $L$ in our model could result in mediator bias. This scenario is presented in @fig-dag-descendent.

### Advice: attend to the temporal order of all measured variables

To mitigate the issue of mediator bias, particularly when focusing on total effects, we should generally avoid conditioning on a mediator. We avoid this problem by ensuring that $L$ occurs before the treatment $A$ and the outcome $Y$ (Note: a counter-example is presented in @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2). Again, we discover the importance of explicitly stating the temporal ordering of our variables.[^11]

[^11]: Note that if $L$ were associated with $Y$ and could not be caused by $A$, conditioning on $L$ would typically enhance the precision of the causal effect estimate of $A \to Y$. This precision enhancement holds even if $L$ occurs after $A$. However, the onus is on the researcher to show that the post-treatment factor cannot be a consequence of the exposure.

### 4. Conditioning on a descendant

Say $L$ is a cause of $L^\prime$. According to Markov factorisation, if we condition on $L$, we partially condition on $L^\prime$.

Consider how conditioning might imperil causal estimation. Suppose there is a confounder $L^\prime$ that is caused by an unobserved variable $U$, and is affected by the treatment $A$. Suppose further that $U$ causes the outcome $Y$. In this scenario, as described in @fig-dag-descendent, conditioning on $L^\prime$, which is a descendant of $A$ and $U$, can lead to a spurious association between $A$ and $Y$ through the path $A \to L^\prime \to U \to Y$.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-descendent
#| fig-cap: "Confounding by descent: the red dashed arrow illustrates the introduction of bias from the opening of a backdoor path between the exposure (A) and the outcome (Y) when conditioning on a descendant of a confounder."

\begin{tikzpicture}[{every node/.append style}=draw]

\node [rectangle, draw=white] (U) at (0, 0) {U};
\node [ellipse, draw=white] (A) at (2, 0) {$A_{t0}$};
\node [rectangle, draw=black](L) at (4, 0) {$L^\prime_{t1}$};
\node [ellipse, draw=white] (Y) at (6, 0) {$Y_{t2}$};

\draw [-latex, bend right=50] (U) to (L);

\draw [-latex,draw=black] (A) to (L);
\draw [-latex, bend left, draw=red, dashed] (A) to (Y);

\end{tikzpicture}
```

Again, the advice is clear: we should measure the ($L^\prime$) before the exposure ($A$). This solution is presented in @fig-dag-descendent-solution.

```{tikz}

#| fig-cap: "Solution: again, ensure temporal ordering for all measured variables."

\node [rectangle, draw=white](A) at (4, 0) {$A_{t1}$};
\node [ellipse, draw=white] (Y) at (6, 0) {$Y_{t2}$};

\draw [-latex, draw=black] (U) to (L);
\draw [-latex, draw=black] (L) to (A);
\draw [-latex, bend right=50, draw =black] (U) to (Y);


\end{tikzpicture}

```

Next consider how we may use a post-treatment descendent to reduce bias. Suppose an unmeasured confounder $U$ affects $A$, $Y$, and $L^\prime$ as presented in, then adjusting for $L^\prime$ may help to reduce confounding caused by $U$. This scenario is presented in @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2. If we deploy the modified disjunctive cause criterion for confounding control, we would "include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome" [@vanderweele2019]. We discover that although $L^\prime$ may occur *after* the exposure, and indeed occur *after* the outcome, we may condition on it to reduce confounding because it is a proxy for an unmeasured common cause of the exposure and the confounder. **This example shows that employing a rule that requires us to condition only on pre-exposure (and indeed pre-outcome) variables would be hasty.**

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-descendent-solution-2

### Case 1: Causal Interaction and Causal Effect Modification: do not draw non-linear relationships such as interactions

Interactions are scientific interesting because we often wish to understand for whom effects occur. How shall we depict interactions on a graph? It is crucial to remember the primary function of causal diagrams is to investigate confounding. Causal diagrams are not designed to capture all facets of a phenomenon under investigation. We should not attempt any unique visual trick to show additive and multiplicative interaction. Including the relevant notes and paths necessary to evaluate sources of bias is sufficient.

Misunderstandings arise about the role and function of causal diagrams in application to interaction. Such misunderstandings typically stem from a more profound confusion about the concept of interaction itself. Given this deeper problem, it is worth clarifying the concept of causal interaction as understood within the counterfactual causal framework. Again, evaluating evidence for interaction is often essential for much scientific research. However, we must distinguish between concepts of causal interaction and concepts of causal effect modification because these concepts address different causal questions.

#### **Causal interaction**

Causal interaction refers to the combined or separate (or non-existent) effect of two exposures. Evidence for interaction on a given scale is present when the effect of one exposure on an outcome hinges on another exposure's level. For instance, the impact of beliefs in Big Gods (exposure A) on social complexity (outcome Y) might be contingent on a culture's monumental architecture (exposure B), which could also influence social complexity. Evidence of causal interaction on the difference scale would be present if:

$$\bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1,1)]}_{\text{joint exposure}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}}\bigg) - \bigg[ \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1,0)]}_{\text{only A exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}}\bigg) + \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(0,1)]}_{\text{only B exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}} \bigg)\bigg] \neq 0 $$

This equation simplifies to

$$ \underbrace{E[Y(1,1)]}_{\text{joint exposure}} - \underbrace{E[Y(1,0)]}_{\text{only A exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,1)]}_{\text{only B exposed}} + \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}} \neq 0 $$

If the above equation were to hold, the effect of exposure $A$ on the outcome $Y$ would differ across levels of $B$ or vice versa. Such a difference would provide evidence for interaction.

If the value is positive, we say there is evidence for an additive effect. If the value is less than zero, we say there is evidence for a sub-additive effect. If the value is virtually zero, there is no reliable evidence for interaction.[^12]

[^12]: Note that causal effects of interactions often differ when measured on the ratio scale. This discrepency can have significant policy implications, see: [@vanderweele2014]. Although beyond the scope of this article, when evaluating evidence for causality we must clarify the measure of effect in which we are interested [@hernán2004; @tripepi2007].

Remember that causal diagrams are non-parametric. They do not directly represent interactions. They are tools for addressing the identification problem. Although a causal diagram can indicate an interaction's presence by displaying two exposures jointly influencing an outcome, as in @fig-dag-interaction, it does not directly represent the interaction's nature or scale.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-interaction
#| fig-cap: "Causal interaction: if two exposures are causally independent of each other, we may wish to estimate their individual and joint effects on Y, where the counterfactual outcome is Y(a,b) and there is evidence for additive or subadditive interaction if E[Y(1,1) - Y(0,1) - Y(1,0) + Y(0,0)] ≠ 0. If we cannot conceptualise B as a variable upon which intervention can occur, then the interaction is better conceived as effect modification (see next figure). Important: do not attempt to draw a path into another path."

#### **Causal effect modification**

With the analysis of effect modification, we aim to understand how an exposure's effect varies, if at all, across levels of another variable, an effect modifier.

Suppose we are investigating how the impact of belief in Big Gods on social complexity varies across early urban civilisations in ancient China and South America. Here, geography (China versus South America) is an "effect modifier." Importantly, we are not treating the effect modifier as an intervention. Rather, we wish to investigate whether geography is a parameter that may alter the exposure's effect on an outcome.

For clarity, consider comparing two exposure levels, represented as $A = a$ and $A= a^*$. Further, assume that $G$ represents two levels of effect-modification, represented as $g$ and $g'$.

Then, the expected outcome when exposure is at level $A=a$ among individuals in group $G=g$ is expressed

$$\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g]$$

The expected outcome when exposure is at level $A=a^*$ among individuals in group $G=g$ is expressed

$$\hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g]$$

The causal effect of shifting the exposure level from $a^*$ to $a$ in group $g$ is expressed

$$\hat{\delta}_g = \hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g]$$

Likewise, the causal effect of changing the exposure from $a^*$ to $a$ in group $g'$ is expressed

$$\hat{\delta}_{g'} = \hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g'] - \hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g']$$

We compare the causal effect on the difference scale in these two groups by computing

$$\hat{\gamma} = \hat{\delta}_g - \hat{\delta}_{g'}$$

The value of $\hat{\gamma}$ quantifies how the effect of shifting the exposure from $a^*$ to $a$ differs between groups $g$ and $g'$.

If $\hat{\gamma}\neq 0$, then there is evidence for effect modification. We may infer the exposure's effect varies by geography.

Again, remember that causal diagrams are non-parametric. Do not draw an intersecting path or attempt other visualisations to represent effect modification. Instead, draw two edges into the exposure. This is depicted in @fig-dag-effect-modfication. Always remember that the primary goal of creating a causal diagram is to evaluate confounding.[^13]

### Case 2: Causal Mediation: causal diagrams reveal the inadequacy of standard approaches

The conditions necessary for causal mediation are stringent. I present these conditions in the chronologically ordered causal diagram shown in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions. We will again consider whether cultural beliefs in Big Gods affect social complexity. Let us also ask whether this affect is mediated by political authority. The assumptions required for asking causal mediation questions are as follows

1.  **No unmeasured exposure-outcome confounders given** $L$

This prerequisite is expressed as $Y(a,m) \coprod A | L1$. Upon controlling for the covariate set $L1$, we must ensure that no additional unmeasured confounders affect both the cultural beliefs in Big Gods $A$ and the social complexity $Y$. For example, suppose our study involves the effect of cultural beliefs in Big Gods (exposure) on social complexity (outcome), and geographic location and historical context define the covariates in $L1$. In that case, we must assume that accounting for $L1$ ensures d-separation of $A$ and $Y$. The relevant confounding path is depicted in brown in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

2.  **No unmeasured mediator-outcome confounders given** $L$

This condition is expressed as $Y(a,m) \coprod M | L2$. After controlling for the covariate set $L2$, we must ensure that no other unmeasured confounders affect the political authority $M$ and social complexity $Y$. For instance, if trade networks impact political authority and social complexity, we must account for trade networks to obstruct the unblocked path linking our mediator and outcome. Further, we must assume the absence of any other confounders for the mediator-outcome path. This confounding path is represented in blue in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

3.  **No unmeasured exposure-mediator confounders given** $L$

This requirement is expressed as $M(a) \coprod A | L3$. Upon controlling for the covariate set $L3$, we must ensure that no additional unmeasured confounders affect both the cultural beliefs in Big Gods $A$ and political authority $M$. For example, the capability to construct large ritual theatres may influence the belief in Big Gods and the level of political authority. If we have indicators for this technology measured prior to the emergence of Big Gods (these indicators being $L3$), we must assume that accounting for $L3$ closes the backdoor path between the exposure and the mediator. This confounding path is shown in green in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions.

4.  **No mediator-outcome confounder affected by the exposure (no red arrow)**

This requirement is expressed as $Y(a,m) \coprod M(a^*) | L$. We must ensure that no variables confounding the relationship between political authority and social complexity in $L2$ are themselves influenced by the cultural beliefs in Big Gods ($A$). For instance, when studying the effect of cultural beliefs in Big Gods ($A$, the exposure) on social complexity ($Y$, the outcome) as mediated by political authority (mediator), there can be no factors, such as trade networks ($L2$), that influence both political authority and social complexity and are affected by the belief in Big Gods. This confounding path is shown in red in @fig-dag-mediation-assumptions. **Note that the assumption of no exposure-induced confounding in the mediator-outcome relationship poses a significant challenge for causal mediation** If the exposure influences a confounder of the mediator and outcome, we face a dilemma. Without accounting for this confounder, the backdoor path between the mediator and the outcome remains open. By accounting for it, however, we partially obstruct the path between the exposure and the mediator, leading to bias. Consequently, observed data cannot identify the natural direct and indirect effects.

Notice again that the requirements for counterfactual data science are more strict than for descriptive or predictive data science.

Nonetheless, we can set the mediator to certain levels and explore controlled direct and indirect effects, which may be relevant to science and policy. For instance, if we were to fix political authority at a specific level, we could ask, what would be Big Gods' direct and indirect causal effects on social complexity? Other approaches involve sampling from the observed distributions to obtain probabilistic identification (see: [@shi2021] ). Answering such questions requires G-methods [@hernán2023a]).

We have now considered how chronologically ordered causal diagrams elucidate the conditions necessary for causal mediation analysis.[^14]

[^14]: An excellent resource both for understanding causal interaction and causal mediation is [@vanderweele2015].

The blue edges denote the path for common causes of the mediator and outcome. To block this path we must condition on L2. The red path denotes the effect of the exposure on the confounder of the mediator and outcome. If any such path exists then we cannot obtain natural direct and indirect effects. Conditioning on L2 is necessary to prevent mediator outcome confounding but doing so blocks the effect of the exposure on the mediator."

### Case 3: Confounder-Treatment Feedback: Longitudinal "growth" is not causation

In our discussion of causal mediation, we consider how the effects of two sequential exposures may combine to affect an outcome. We can broaden this interest to consider the causal effects of multiple sequential exposures. In such scenarios, causal diagrams arranged chronologically can aid in clarifying the challenges and opportunities.

For example, consider temporally fixed multiple exposures. The counterfactual outcomes may be denoted $Y(a_{t1} ,a_{t2})$. There are four counterfactual outcomes corresponding to the four fixed "treatment regimes":

1.  **Always treat (Y(1,1))**

2.  **Never treat (Y(0,0))**

3.  **Treat once first (Y(1,0))**

4.  **Treat once second (Y(0,1))**

| Type     | Description                            | Counterfactual Outcome |
|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Regime   | Always treat                           | Y(1,1)                 |
| Regime   | Never treat                            | Y(0,0)                 |
| Regime   | Treat once first                       | Y(1,0)                 |
| Regime   | Treat once second                      | Y(0,1)                 |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Never treat           | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(0,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Treat once first      | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(1,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Always treat vs. Treat once second     | E\[Y(1,1) - Y(0,1)\]   |
| Contrast | Never treat vs. Treat once first       | E\[Y(0,0) - Y(1,0)\]   |
| Contrast | Never treat vs. Treat once second      | E\[Y(0,0) - Y(0,1)\]   |
| Contrast | Treat once first vs. Treat once second | E\[Y(1,0) - Y(0,1)\]   |

: Table describes four fixed treatment regimes and six causal contrasts in time series data where the exposure may vary. {#tbl-regimes}

There are six causal contrasts that we might compute for the four fixed regimes, presented in @tbl-regimes.[^15]

[^15]: We compute the number of possible combinations of contrasts by $C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!}$

Not that treatment assignments might be sensibly approached as a function of the previous outcome. For example, we might **treat once first** and then decide whether to treat again depending on the outcome of the initial treatment. This aspect is known as "time-varying treatment regimes."

It is important to remember that to estimate the "effect" of a time-varying treatment regime, we must compare the counterfactual quantities of interest. Just as mediation introduces the possibility of time-varying confounding (condition 4, where the exposure affects the confounders of the mediator/outcome path), so too do all sequential time-varying treatments. Unlike traditional causal mediation analysis, however, we might consider the sequence of treatment regimes indefinitely long.

Chronologically organised causal diagrams are useful for highlighting problems with traditional multi-level regression analysis and structural equation modelling.

For example, we might be interested in whether belief in Big Gods affects social complexity. Consider estimating a fixed treatment regime first. Suppose we have a well-defined concept of Big Gods and social complexity as well as excellent measurements for both over time. In that case, we might want to assess the effects of beliefs in Big Gods on social complexity, say, two centuries after the beliefs were introduced.

The fixed treatment strategies are: "always believe in Big Gods" versus "never believe in Big Gods" on the level of social complexity. Refer to @fig-dag-9. Here, $A_{tx}$ represents the cultural belief in Big Gods at time $tx$, and $Y_{tx}$ is the outcome, social complexity, at time $x$. Imagine that economic trade, denoted as $L_{tx}$, is a time-varying confounder. Suppose its effect changes over time, which in turns affects the factors that influence economic trade. To complete our causal diagram, we might include an unmeasured confounder $U$, such as oral traditions, which could influence both the belief in Big Gods and social complexity.

Suppose we can credibly think that the level of economic trade at time $0$, $L_{t0}$, influence beliefs in "Big Gods" at time $1$, $A_{t1}$. We therefore draw an arrow from $L_{t0}$ to $A_{t1}$. But we may also think the belief in "Big Gods", $A_{t1}$, affects the future level of economic trade, $L_{t(2)}$. Thus, we must add an arrow from $A_{t1}$ to $L_{t2}$. This causal diagram represents a feedback process between the time-varying exposure $A$ and the time-varying confounder $L$. @fig-dag-9 shows exposure-confounder feedback. In a real-world setting, there would be more arrows. However, our causal diagram needs only to show the minimum number of arrows to exhibit the problem of exposure-confounder feedback. As a rule, we should not clutter our causal diagrams: we should only provide the essential details to evaluate the identification problem.

What would happen if we were to condition on the time-varying confounder $L_{t3}$? Two things would occur. First, we would block all the backdoor paths between the exposure $A_{t2}$ and the outcome. We need to block those paths to eliminate confounding. Therefore, conditioning on the time-varying confounding is essential. However, paths that were previously blocked would close. For example, the path $A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{t4}$, that was previously closed would be opened because the time-varying confounder is the common effect of $A_{t1}$ and $U$. Conditioning, then, opens the path $A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{t4}$. Therefore we must avoid conditioning on the time-varying confounder. It would seem then that if we were to condition on a confounder that is affected by the prior exposure, we are "damned if we do" and "dammed if we do not."

Here, we may not use conventional methods to estimate the effects of multiple exposures. Instead, at best, we may obtain controlled effects using G-methods. Multi-level models will not eliminate bias (!). However, outside of epidemiology, G-methods are presently too rarely used."

A similar problem arises when a time-varying exposure and time-varying confounder share a common cause. This problem arises even without the exposure affecting the confounder. The problem is presented in @fig-dag-time-vary-common-cause-A1-l1.

Opportunities for confounding grow when the exposure $A_{t1}$ influences the outcome $Y_{t4}$. For instance, because $L_{t2}$ lies on the pathway from $A_{t1}$ to $Y_{t4}$, conditioning on $L_{t2}$ partially obstructs the connection between exposure and outcome. Such conditioning triggers both collider stratification bias and mediator bias. However, to close the open backdoor path between $L_{t2}$ and $Y_{t4}$, conditioning on $L_{t2}$ is necessary. Yet we have just said that we must not condition. The broader challenge of exposure-confounder feedback is detailed in [@hernán2023a]. This issue poses a significant problem for evolutionary human sciences, and conventional regression-based methods --- including multi-level models --- are incapable of solving it [@hernán2006; @robins1999; @robins1986]. As mentioned, models suited for evaluating the causal effects of time-fixed and time-varying exposures are encompassed by "G-methods" [@naimi2017; @chatton2020; @hernán2006]. Even though such methods have seen considerable development recently in the health sciences [@williams2021; @díaz2021; @breskin2020], they have yet to be as widely adopted in the human evolutionary sciences [^16]

[^16]: It is worth noting that the identification of controlled effect estimates can benefit from graphical methods such as "Single World Intervention Graphs" (SWIGs), which depict counterfactual outcomes on the diagrams. Nevertheless, SWIGs, in their general form, are templates rather than causal diagrams. The application of SWIGS extends beyond this tutorial's scope. Refer to @richardson2013 for more about SWIGs.

### Summary Part 2

To consistently estimate causal effects, we must contrast the world as it has been with the world as it might have been. For many questions in evolutionary human science, we have seen that confounder-treatment feedback leads to intractable causal identification problems. We have also seen that causal diagrams are helpful in clarifying these problems. Many self-inflicted injuries, such as mediator bias and post-stratification bias, could be avoided if confounders were measured prior to the exposures. Chronologically ordered causal diagrams aim to make this basis transparent.

I next turn to three-wave designs for estimating the total causal effects. Such designs find inspiration from chronologically ordered causal diagrams. They may be beneficial for evolutionary anthropologists who wish to collect time-series data in the present and future to address causal questions.

## Part 3. Applications of Causal Diagrams to the Understanding of Data Collection in a Three-Wave Panel Design

In this section, we discuss how temporally ordered causal diagrams can help illustrate the benefits of a three-wave panel design for addressing causal queries using data.

### Step 1. Defining the exposure: measure it at wave 0 and wave 1

We start with a well-defined exposure. Unless our focus lies in causal interaction, causal mediation, or sequential treatment plans, our task will be to examine the total effect of a single exposure.

Consider the causal effect of attending religious services. Our primary task is to define the exposure as a hypothetical intervention. What interests us? Any attendance versus non-attendance? Weekly attendance versus monthly attendance? Or is it something else? Imagining a hypothetical experiment, even if impractical, highlights the importance of specifying an explicit intervention [@hernán2022; @hernán2016a].

Controlling for the exposure at the baseline also has an additional benefit: it can lower the probability of bias from unmeasured confounders. We shall say more about this benefit after introducing the next step.

#### **Note: without access to an exposed population,if the exposure is rare, many observations must be collected to estimate causal effects**

Assume in the non-religious population, the switch from no religious service attendance to weekly attendance is rare, say 1 in 1,000 non-attenders per year. Acquiring an adequate sample for a "treatment" group while conditioning on a rich set of variables might not be feasible without hundreds of thousands of participants. It might be more practical to consider changes within the religious population, assuming changes are more common within this group. However, we would then typically estimate a causal effect that generalises to the religious population from which the sample was drawn rather than one that transports to the non-religious population.

### Step 2. Define the outcome(s): measure them at wave 0 and wave 2

After defining the exposure, we need to specify a well-defined outcome or multiple outcomes. For instance, we might be interested in how gaining or losing religious service affects the frequency of volunteering (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Vague concepts such as "the causal effects of religious change" do not bring understanding. We must specify what the phenomenon we wish to study, and the timing of its occurrence (e.g. the + 1-year effect on weekly volunteering from a movement of 0 to weekly or more religious service attendance.)

It is crucial to control for the outcome measured at the baseline -- the 'baseline outcome' -- to verify the correct temporal order of the cause-effect relationship, i.e., to prevent reverse causation.

Moreover, when we also control for the exposure at the baseline, then for an unmeasured confounder to explain away the association between the exposure at one wave from the baseline and the outcome at two waves from the baseline, it would need to do so independently of the baseline effect. This scenario is depicted in @fig-dag-6. This causal diagram makes an essential practical point: although confounding might not be entirely eliminated (the dashed arrows symbolise the potential for uncontrolled sources of bias), data collection and analysis can reduce bias. Given we can rarely be sure we have controlled for unmeasured confounding, researchers should perform sensitivity analyses (see: [@shi2021]).

Note that I use the term "wave" without defining a specific period. Causes must precede effects, but the amount of time needed to assess causality will vary depending on the phenomena of interest. In a causal diagram, **intervals need not be drawn to scale.**

\end{tikzpicture}
```

### Step 3. Identify observable common causes of the exposure and the outcome

Next, we should identify all the potential confounders that, when adjusted for, can eliminate any non-causal association between the exposure and outcome. We should group these confounders under standard labels wherever they share the same functional dependencies in the graph. In a three-wave panel design, confounders are recorded during the baseline wave. As illustrated in @fig-dag-mediator-solution, recording confounders before the occurrence of the exposure minimises the potential for mediation bias.

### Step 4. Gather data for proxy variables of unmeasured common causes at the baseline wave

Recall @fig-dag-descendent-solution-2: if any unmeasured factors influence both the exposure and outcome, but we lack direct measurements for them, we should make efforts to include proxies for them. Again, even if this strategy cannot eliminate all bias from unmeasured confounding, it might reduce bias.

### Step 5. State the target population for whom the causal question applies

We need to define for whom our causal inference applies. For this purpose, it is helpful to distinguish the concepts of source population and target population and between the concepts of generalisability and transportability.

1.  **The source population** is the population from whom our sample is drawn.

2.  **The target population** is the larger group to which we aim to apply our study's results. The closer the source population matches the target population in structural features relevant to our causal questions, the stronger our causal inferences about the target population will be.

3.  **Generalisability**: when the causal effect estimated from a sample applies to the target population beyond the sample population, we say the causal effect estimates are generalisable. This concept is also known as "external validity."

Let $PATE$ denote the population average treatment effect for the target population. Let $ATE_{\text{source}}$ denote the average treatment effect in the source population. Let $W$ denote a set of variables upon which the source and target population structurally differ. We say that results *generalise* if there is a function such that

$$PATE =  f(ATE_{\text{source}}, W)$$

4.  **Transportability**: when causal effects estimates may generalise to different settings and populations from which the source population was sampled, we say effects are transportable. Where $T$ denotes a set of variables upon which the source and the target population structurally differ, we say that results are transportable if there is a function such that

$$ATE_{\text{target}} \approx f(ATE_{\text{source}}, T)$$

This function similarly maps the average treatment effect from the source population to a target population. The function over $T$ might be more complex, as it must handle potential heterogeneity of effects and unobserved sources of bias. To assess transportability, we generally require information about the source and target populations and a specialist understanding. In Section 4, we will return to the concepts of generalisability and transportability as they pertain to sample selection.

### Step 6. Retention is a top priority

Sample retention is a mission-critical imperative for reasons we clarify in Part 4. Panel attrition opens novel pathways for bias. Researchers must develop protocols for tracking individuals as they change addresses, emails, phone numbers, and names. Moreover, developing and implementing strategies for motivating retention across the entire population of interest (not merely those willing to volunteer for science) is critical for causal human science. These strategies must be developed with specialist knowledge of the population under study and the participation and insights of the people being studied.

### Summary of Part 3

The strengths of three-wave panel designs for confounding control are demonstrated in @fig-dag-6. This diagram, adapted from @vanderweele2020, highlights the potential for residual unmeasured confounding even after incorporating baseline measurements for both the exposure and outcome, represented by the blue-dotted line. As such, for an unmeasured confounder $U$ to exert bias on the association between the exposure $A_{t1}$ and outcome $Y_{t2}$, it must do so independently of the baseline measurements of the exposure $A_{t0}$ and outcome $Y_{t0}$.

The diagram also reveals the advantage of three-wave panel designs for addressing reverse causation. This control is achieved by adjusting for both the exposure and outcome at baseline, ensuring the temporal sequence causality required. Moreover, the diagram underscores the capacity of three-wave panel designs to yield estimates for the incidence, not just the prevalence, of effects.

A further understanding gained from @fig-dag-6 is related to the potential risks associated with collider stratification and mediator bias. As discussed in Part 2, bias may arise from conditioning on a variable measured after treatment. We can significantly reduce such biases by ensuring the measurement of confounders takes place before the exposure and by ensuring that the exposure is measured before the outcome.

@fig-dag-6 emphasises these factors' crucial role in guiding the collection of repeated measures data. Nonetheless, @vanderweele2020's causal diagram does not account for potential bias from panel attrition. In Part 4, we will develop this causal diagram to clarify such challenges.

## Part 4. Applications of Causal Diagrams to the Understanding of Selection Bias

### Introduction to selection bias

*Selection bias* may be broadly defined as the discrepancy between the parameter of interest in a target population and the same parameter in a subset of the population used for analysis - the source population [@hernán2017]. This bias can occur if the source population differs from the target population regarding descriptive parameters. In causal inference, our concern is how selection bias might impact the estimation of causal effects. In other words, how might differences between the source and target populations influence causal contrasts on specific scales of interest (difference, risk ratio, rate ratio, or another)? Causal diagrams help to show what is at stake.

It is useful first to consider the following topology of confounding developed by Suzuki and colleagues [@suzuki2016; @suzuki2014; @suzuki2020].[^17]

[^17]: This typology builds on VanderWeele's work [@vanderweele2012].

1.  **Confounding in distribution**: if the sample exposed to each level of exposure is representative of the target population, we say there is no confounding in the distribution of the exposure's effect on the outcome.

2.  **Confounding in expectation** If the exposure assignment mechanism balances the confounders across each level of contrast in the exposure, we say there is no confounding in the expectation of the exposure's effect on the outcome.

3.  **Confounding in measure**: if a specific measure of interest matches the corresponding causal measure in the target population, we say there is no confounding in the measure of the exposure's effect on the outcome. As discussed previously concerning interaction, our inference of a causal effect can depend on the scale of the causal effect measure.

4.  **Realised confounding**: if a specific exposure assignment leads to balance, irrespective of the exposure assignment mechanism, we say there is no realised confounding of the exposure's effect on the outcome. This concept is essential because, even in randomised experiments, randomisation might not eliminate chance imbalances in the distributions of confounders across the exposures.

Each of these four concepts plays a role in "confounding" discussions, and all are crucial when evaluating a study's scientific merit. However, each concept highlights different issues.

Armed with these distinctions, consider @fig-selection-under-the-null, which presents a scenario with no (marginal) causal effect of exposure on the outcome, yet a degree of selection into the study. We will assume randomisation succeeded and that are no arrows into $A$. As @fig-selection-under-the-null shows, neither confounding in expectation nor confounding in distribution is present. Failure to detect an association will accurately reflect the actual state of causal disassociation in the population. We might say that selection leads to "confounding in distribution for confounding in expectation." More simply, we might say that despite selection, the null effect in the source population is not biased for the target population [@hernán2004; @greenland1977].[^18]

[^18]: Note we use the term "null effect" as a structural concept. There are no statistical "null effects." Instead there are reliable or unreliable statistical effect estimates according to some measure of evidence and arbitrary threshold [@bulbulia2021].

@fig-selection-off-the-null presents a different scenario in which there is selection bias for the population parameter: the association in the population of selected individuals differs from the causal association in the target population. Hernán calls this scenario "selection bias off the null" [@hernán2017]. Lu et al. call this scenario "type 2 selection bias" [@lu2022]. This bias occurs because the selection into the study occurs on an effect modifier for the effect of the exposure on the outcome. Note that although the causal effect of $A\to Y$ is unbiased for the exposed and unexposed in the source population, the effect estimate does not generalise to the exposed and unexposed in the target population: $PATE \cancel{\approx} ATE_{\text{sample}}$.

There has been considerable technical research investigating the conditions under which causal estimates for a target population may be identified when the source population differs from the target population (see: [@lu2022]). There has also been considerable technical research investigating the conditions in which results might transport to populations that systematically differ from the source population (see: [@bareinboim2022; @pearl2022; @deffner2022]).To address type 2 selection bias in a three-wave pane, we must accurately measure and adjust for a sufficient set of covariates that affect selection $\framebox{S}$ [@lu2022]. Moreover, when drawing causal diagrams, it is vital to present confounding as it is assumed to exist in the target population, not the source population (see @suzuki2020, especially their examples in the supplement.)

### Selection bias in which both the exposure and outcome affect censoring

In panel designs, there is additionally a constant threat of selection occurring *after* enrolment into the study. We next put chronological causal diagrams to use to make sense of this threat and derive practical advice.

We next use causal diagrams to disclose biases arising from panel attrition. Panel attrition can be viewed as a special case of selection bias because the participants who continue in a longitudinal study may differ from those who drop out in ways that generate structural biases.

@fig-dag-8-5 describes a scenario in which both the exposure and the true outcome affect panel attrition, biasing the observed association between the exposure and the measured outcome in the remaining sample. The problem of selection here is a problem of collider stratification bias. We can equivalently view the problem as one of directed measurement error, described in in @fig-dag-indep-d-effect. Either way, restricting the analysis to the retained sample introduces bias in the causal effect estimate by opening a backdoor path from the exposure to the outcome. @lu2022 call this form of bias: "type 1 selection bias" and distinguishes between scenarios when causal effects that generalise are recoverable (type 1a selection bias) and not recoverable (type 1b selection bias). In both cases, we must develop strategies to recover target population estimates from a subset of the source population for which causal effect estimates may be biased **for the source population.**

### Selection bias in a three-wave panel

@fig-dag-8 shows selection bias manifest in a three-wave panel design when loss-to-follow-up results in a systematic disparity between the baseline and follow-up source populations. The red dashed lines in the diagram represent an open backdoor path, revealing a potential indirect association between the exposure and the outcome. Upon considering only the selected sample (i.e., when we condition on the selected sample $\framebox{S}$), we may create or obscure associations not evident in the source population at baseline.

### Unmeasured confounder affects outcome and variable that affects attrition

@fig-dag-8-2 presents another problem of selection bias in a three-wave panel design. This diagram shows how an unmeasured confounder, U$_S$, can simultaneously influence the outcome variable Y$_{t2}$ and another variable, L$_{t2}$, responsible for attrition (i.e., the drop-out rate, denoted as $\framebox{S}$). Here we present a scenario in which the exposure variable $A_{t1}$ can impact a post-treatment confounder L$_{t2}$, which subsequently affects attrition, $\framebox{S}$. If the study's selected sample descends from L$_2$, the selection effectively conditions on L$_{t2}$, potentially introducing bias into the analysis. @fig-dag-8-2 marks this biasing pathway with red-dashed lines. Ordering the nodes chronologically in one's graph elucidates the assumed temporal sequence of events, allowing for a more precise assessment of potential bias sources relevant to a three-wave panel design.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-8-2
#| fig-cap: "Causal diagram of a three-wave panel design with selection bias: example 2: Unmeasured confounder U_S, is a cause of both of the outcome Y_2 and of a variable, L_2 that affects attrition,  S.

Such conditioning opens a biasing path, indicated by the red-dashed lines."

### Why regression adjustment fails to address select bias from attrition

We cannot address selection bias from attrition using regression. Shifting the example from culture to health, suppose that sicker individuals or those with less successful outcomes are likelier to drop out of the study. If this occurs, the remaining sample will not represent the original population; it will over-represent healthier individuals or those with more successful outcomes.

We use regression adjustment to control for confounding variables across the treatment groups. With loss-to-follow-up, regression adjustment can only address selection bias. The remaining censored population may differ from the source population in the average association between the exposure and the outcome.

What to do?

1.  **Prevention**: obviously, the best way to deal with missing data is to prevent it in the first place. Maintain regular contact with study participants, using incentives for continued participation, making follow-ups as convenient as possible, and tracking participant details from multiple sources (email, phone, secondary contacts).

2.  **Missing data imputation**: this requires predicting the missing values based on our data, assuming that the missingness is random conditional on baseline measures. Note that this missingness should be predicted separately within strata of the exposed and unexposed in the previous wave (see: [@westreich2015; @zhang2023]). Imputation methods typically assume that data are missing conditional on a correctly specified model and information obtained at baseline.

3.  **Inverse probability weighting with censoring weights**: this requires weighting the values of each participant in the study by the inverse of the probability of their observed pattern of missingness (censoring weights)[@leyrat2019; @cole2008]. In this approach, the sample gives more weight to under-represented individuals owing to drop-out. As with missing data imputation, IPW with censoring weights also assumes that we can correctly model the missingness from the observed data.

4.  **Sensitivity analysis**: as with nearly all causal inference, we should quantitatively evaluate how sensitive results are to different assumptions and methods for handling censoring events [@shi2021].

### Summary of Part 4

In this segment, I used causal diagrams to elucidate potential confounding from selection bias. Here is the take-home advice:

1.  **Broad sampling**: to ensure that the results of your study can be generalised, strive to sample extensively from the target population. A broad sample will offer more opportunities to measure all effect modifiers. With these data.

2.  **Accurate measurement and adjustment for covariates**: in developing a three-wave panel, addressing type 2 selection bias requires precise measurements and appropriate confounding control [@lu2022]. Failing to measure and adjust for these covariates may lead to erroneous conclusions about the relationship between exposure and outcome.

3.  **Construct causal diagrams for the target population**: causal diagrams should represent confounding as it exists in the target population (see @suzuki2020, especially the supplementary materials provided).

4.  **Maximise retention**: retention, retention, retention. Rention is the mission-critical objective.

5.  **Use multiple imputation or inverse probability of treatment with censoring weights to adjust for attrition** Achieving a 100% retention rate is typically unattainable. To reduce disparities between the source population at baseline and the population from which the censored participants were drawn.

6.  **Perform sensitivity analyses** to assess the robustness of results to methods for handling attrition.

## Part 5. Applications of Causal Diagrams to the Understanding of Measurement Bias

Here, we use causal diagrams to clarify bias through vectors of measurement error and discuss implications for research design. Following @hernán2009, we first define structural concepts of measurement error and draw causal diagrams to understand how they may bias causal effect estimates (see also [@vanderweele2012]).

### 1. Uncorrelated non-differential (undirected) measurement error

As shown in @fig-dag-uu-null, an uncorrelated non-differential measurement error occurs when the errors in the measurement of the exposure and outcome are not related.

To clarify, consider again the task of estimating the causal effect of beliefs in Big Gods on social complexity. Suppose ancient societies randomly omitted or recorded details about both beliefs in Big Gods and indicators of social complexity in their records. Alternatively, suppose that such records were not preserved equally across cultures for reasons unrelated to these parameters. In this case, errors in the documentation of both variables would be random. The errors would not be related to the intensity of the beliefs in Big Gods or the level of social complexity. This example of uncorrelated and non-differential error is presented in @fig-dag-uu-null.

Uncorrelated non-differential measurement error does not create bias under the null. As evident from @fig-dag-uu-null, d-separation is preserved. Equivalently, there are no open backdoor paths on the graph. However, when there is an actual effect of the exposure on the outcome, non-differential measurement error generally leads to attenuated effect estimates. For this reason, uncorrelated non-differential measurement error can be problematic for inference even though it does not induce structural bias under the null.

\end{tikzpicture}
```

### 2. Uncorrelated differential (directed) measurement error

As shown in @fig-dag-indep-d-effect, uncorrelated differential (or directed) measurement error occurs when the measurement errors are related to the level of exposure or outcome but not to each other. For instance, societies with stronger beliefs in Big Gods might have more or less detailed records of social complexity. Suppose that, in the absence of any intervention on beliefs in Gods, there is no association between the measurement errors. Here, the errors are differential as they depend on the intensity of religious beliefs but are uncorrelated as the errors in documenting beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity are otherwise independent. Uncorrelated differential (or directed) measurement error is presented in @fig-dag-indep-d-effect and leads to bias under the null, indicated by the red path. Alternatively, equivalently, uncorrelated differential (or directed) measurement error opens a backdoor path between the exposure and the outcome.

Note that the bias presented in @fig-dag-indep-d-effect, an example of directed measurement error, also describes the bias we considered when there is panel attrition and which the exposure affects selection (see: @fig-dag-8-5). In that scenario, the outcome in the selected group is measured with error -- it no longer represents the measurement of the outcome in the source population at baseline -- furthermore, this error is affected by exposure. The previous example described bias in estimation from the vantage point of collider stratification; however, we can also explain the distortion as directed measurement bias.

### 3. Correlated non-differential (undirected) measurement error

As shown, @fig-dag-dep-u-effect correlated non-differential (undirected) measurement error occurs when the errors in measuring both the exposure and outcome are related independently of the exposure. The scenario is presented in @fig-dag-dep-u-effect. Imagine that some societies had more advanced record-keeping systems that resulted in more accurate and detailed accounts of both beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity. Furthermore, imagine that record keepers provide better information about religious beliefs. In this case, the errors between beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity are correlated because the accuracy of records for both variables is influenced by the same underlying factor (the record-keeping abilities). However, the errors are not directed insofar as levels of religious beliefs and social complexity do not affect the assumed bias in record keeping. Correlated non-differential measurement error may induce bias under the null, indicated by the red path in @fig-dag-dep-u-effect.

### 4. Correlated differential (directed) measurement error

Correlated differential (directed) measurement error occurs when the measurement errors are related independently of the exposure, and the exposure also affects levels of these correlated error terms. The structure of this bias is presented in @fig-dag-d-d. Suppose societies with stronger beliefs in Big Gods tend to record their religious beliefs and social structures more meticulously than others. Suppose further that religious elites conduct this record-keeping. The errors may be both correlated and differential if societies with beliefs in Big Gods tend to favour these religious elites, leading to biased records.

Consider further the three-wave panel design, where we aim to estimate the effect of self-reported religious service attendance on self-reported monthly donations to charity. A set of confounders is included at baseline, comprising previous measures of religious service attendance and monthly donations to charity. Because our measures rely on self-reports, they may be especially prone to measurement error.

Assume there is an unmeasured common cause affecting both the measurement error of religious service attendance and the measurement error of donations to charity. This bias might occur if individuals consistently over- or under-report their religious service attendance and donations due to social desirability bias.

In Part 3, we discussed how including the exposure measured at baseline can reduce confounding in a three-wave panel design. By controlling for the baseline exposure, we effectively adjust for any static characteristics that cause a correlation between the exposure and outcome.

Now for measurement error, including baseline measures could mitigate the impact of these errors on causal effect estimation, provided the errors are random and not systematically associated across time points.

To see this, let $A_0$, $A_1$ denote the exposure at baseline and follow-up, and $Y_0$, $Y_1$ denote the outcome at baseline and follow-up. The true values are denoted without primes, and the measured values are with primes. We assume the measurement error is additive:

$A'_0 = A_0 + UA_0$,

$A'_1 = A_1 + UA_1$,

$Y'_0 = Y_0 + UY_0$,

$Y'_2 = Y_2 + UY_2$,

where $UA_0$, $UA_1$ are the measurement errors for the exposure at baseline and follow-up, and $UY_0$, $UY_2$ are the measurement errors for the outcome at baseline and follow-up. If the errors are correlated, then $Cov(UA_0, UY_0) \neq 0$ and/or $Cov(UA_1, UY_2) \neq 0$.

In a model that includes $A'_0$ and $Y'_0$ as covariates, the estimated effect of $A'_1$ on $Y'_2$ identifies the effect of change in the exposure from baseline to follow-up on the incidence effect. Because our interest is in this incidence effect, we control for the baseline exposure and outcome measures. This strategy will mitigate bias arising from correlated errors if the following conditions hold:

$E(UA_0) = E(UA_1)$ and $E(UY_0) = E(UY_2)$ (i.e., the expectation of the measurement errors does not change over time),

$Cov(UA_0, UY_2) = Cov(UA_1, UY_2)$ (i.e., the correlation between the errors does not change over time).

Thus, including baseline measurements in our model can mitigate undirected measurement errors. However, this solution hinges on the measurement error being undirected and non-differential concerning time. If the measurement error varies over time or affects other variables in the model, baseline measurement control will be inadequate for confounding control (see: [@keogh2020]).

Consider a scenario where individuals who attend religious service more at wave 1 acquire more substantial social desirability bias, becoming more likely to over-report socially desirable behaviours or under-report socially undesirable ones. The structure of this scenario is presented in @fig-dag-d-d. If the measured outcome at wave 2 is charitable giving, the increased social desirability bias could lead to an overestimation of the actual level of giving. Suppose we compare reported charity at wave 2 with reported religious attendance at wave 1. If there is directed measurement bias we might falsely attribute the apparent increase in charity to the increase in religious service attendance, when, in reality, there was over-reporting from social desirability bias that was induced by religious service attendance. Here we can see that if the error of the outcome is affected by the exposure, the causal effect of the increase in religious service on charitable giving might be different from the association presented in the data.

Thus, although controlling for baseline exposure is a powerful strategy for isolating incidence effects and controlling confounding, we have seen that it is not a catch-all solution. Attention to the quality of measures at all time points remains critical.

For instance, to avoid presentation bias, rather than asking whether one has *offered* help, we might ask participants in a multi-wave study whether they have *received help* -- under the assumption that if the religious community is more altruistic than the secular community, the probability of receiving help will be higher.

### Correlated undirected measurement error in comparative cultural research

To comprehend the structural features that might undermine causal inferences in comparative cultural research, consider a simplified scenario. Imagine that before conducting cultural comparisons, the measurement errors of the exposure and outcome variables are uncorrelated, as illustrated in @fig-dag-uu-null. While measurement error can lead to a downward bias off the null, under the null, no bias occurs.

However, when selecting study participants from different cultures -- cultures that inherently vary in interpretations and behaviours — an unmeasured bias under the null can occur, as shown in @fig-dag-dep-u-effect-selection. To highlight this issue, we modify the causal diagram in @fig-dag-uu-null to include participant selection. This act of comparative selection creates a new study population in which the error terms of measures become associated. We cannot condition on cultural membership to block these associations, as it was the act of conditioning that induced them in the new study population.

If we did not undertake comparative sampling, the exposure and outcome would be d-separated under the given scenario, yielding no bias for separate studies, as shown in @fig-dag-uu-null. We cannot resort to stratifying on culture to address this bias, as it is the act of stratifying on culture that gives rise to correlated measurement errors. Conducting separate analyses by culture precludes generalisation, yet science seeks to find generalisations wherever it can. Human scientists strive to identify functions supporting transportable inferences wherever possible (see Part 2).

Yet, given the myriad ways the true structures of the world can align with correlational models, we must be cautious when using conventional invariance testing thresholds as the arbiters for cultural science. Such tests should be considered exploratory tools. They can guide comparative research, but must not replace careful scientific thinking, informed by local expertise. In causal inference, decisions must be tailor-made to fit the specific situation at hand.

### Using causal diagrams to clarify the structural assumptions of latent factor models

Human evolutionary scientists who wish to record cultural evolutionary dynamics in the present may consider using multi-item constructs in their panel studies. Multi-item constructs have long been favoured by traditional psychometric theory. However, classical psychometric theory developed without the benefit of causal approaches. VanderWeele argues that difficulties surface when assessing the causal assumptions of formative and reflective latent factor models [@vanderweele2022]. These models are based on statistical formulations. However, the causal inferences they embody cannot be determined solely by statistical models. This discussion will concentrate on reflective models, although the concerns raised are equally applicable to formative models, and I refer interested readers to: [@vanderweele2022].[^19]

[^19]: In formative models, observed variables are perceived to generate the latent variable. This latent variable is assumed to be a composite of the observed variables, $X_i$, mathematically expressed as $\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i$. The structural assumption is that a single latent variable causally influences the observed variables. This structural is depicted in @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model.

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model
#| fig-cap: "Structural assumptions of the reflective model imply a univariate reality causes the outcome. These assumptions are strong because they exclude multivariate causes of the indicators for constructs, as well as independent effects of the indicators on outcomes.

```

However, VanderWeele notes that the statistical model is consistent with multiple causal models. The presumption that a univariate latent reality underlies the reflective (and formative) latent factor models is a stronger assumption than previously acknowledged. For example, an alternative structural model equally compatible with the data is presented in @fig-dag_multivariate_reality_again. Here, multivariate reality gives rise to the indicators from which we draw our measures. Indeed, for specific widely used measures, the assumption of a univariate reality is so strong that they make testable assumptions, and empirical examination of these assumptions reveals the tests fail [@vanderweele2022b]. Although we cannot determine which structural model is accurate, the data rule out the univariate model.

Although the assumptions of a univariate reality that underlie traditional latent factor models are not generally credible, VanderWeele suggests that construct measures can still find application in research. The key to salvaging latent factor models is to extend the theory of causal inference under multiple interventions to latent factor models [@vanderweele2022]. Specifically, by framing measured variables as functions of indicators that may map onto a complex multivariate underlying reality, we may approach them as coarsened indicators for that reality. As long as the potential outcomes of these coarsened indicators are conditionally independent of their treatment assignments and there is no unmeasured confounding, we may assume the constructs to consistently estimate the causal effects of the complex reality that gives rise to them. This interpretation is presented in @fig-dag-multiple-version-treatment-applied-measurement. Just as with the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatments, there may be circumstances where ensuring conditional exchangeability is unattainable; even when such assurance is feasible, interpreting the results or advocating policy intervention may be problematic. Thus, I maintain a more restrained optimism about this generalisation of the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment. In the subsequent section, I show how a causal diagram helps to clarify the unresolved measurement biases.

### Causal diagrams highlight issues arising from measurement errors within construct components

Consider a three-wave panel with the assumption that no unmeasured confounding exists. We represent the exposure $A$ as a function of indicators, $A_{f(A_1, A_2, ..., A_n)}$, representing a coarsened state of a multivariate reality. Each component of this reality corresponds to a structural element, represented as $\eta_{A_1}, \eta_{A_2}, ..., \eta_{A_n}$, each with associated error terms, $U\eta_{A_1}, U\eta_{A_2}, ..., U\eta_{A_n}$.

We can similarly conceptualise the outcome $Y$, as a function of indicators, $Y_{f(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n)}$, representing a latent reality. This latent reality is composed of the components $\eta_{Y_1}, \eta_{Y_2}, ..., \eta_{Y_n}$, each with their corresponding error terms $U\eta_{Y_1}, U\eta_{Y_2}, ..., U\eta_{Y_n}$.

@fig-dag-coarsen-measurement-error depicts this assumed reality and outlines potential confounding paths due to directed measurement error. Each path consists of a structural component $\eta_{A_n}$ and its associated error term $U\eta_{Y_n}$. We identify three potential confounding paths resulting from directed measurement error.

The potential for confounding from measurement error in panel designs fundamentally relies on the relationships and dependencies among variables, not their quantity. However, it is worth emphasising that, in theory, an increase in the number of latent states or error terms could enhance the potential for confounding. Under simplifying assumptions, the potential direct paths from the exposure to the outcome are given by the product of the number of components of the exposure and the number of error terms associated with the outcome, symbolically represented as $\eta A_n \times U\eta_{Y_n}$. In this simplified scenario, each latent variable connected to exposure could influence every error term of an outcome, creating a complex network of confounding paths.

Causal diagrams applied to measurement error in latent factor models reveal the importance of rigorously considering construct measures in evolutionary and other human sciences. Although there is no universal rule here, researchers might sometimes opt to use single-item measures. Each case, however, demands a meticulous examination of the items' meanings, probable interpretations, and potential causal implications over time.

### Summary Part 5

Part 5 describes sources of bias from measurement error in repeated measures data designs Such designs are powerful tools for quantitatively estimating causal effects. Measurement bias highlights their weaknesses. We have examined four kinds of measurement error bias, assessing how each might skew inference. Although adjustments for the baseline exposure can aid in reducing confounding (and isolate incidence effects), it is not a panacea. Often the exposure, or the source of error in its measurement, may plausibly affect the measurement of the outcome. In such cases, the correlations we obtain may be biased indicators of causation.

Although methods for adjusting for measurement error are not covered in this article, a host of useful resources exists, including the works of @keogh2020 @buonaccorsi2010 @shi2021 @valeri2014 and @bandalos2018. The purpose of this section has been to examine how causal diagrams can be used to reveal sources of counfounding from measurement bias, how measurement bias arises in settings of comparative cultural research, why latent factor models claim too much, and why in some cases single item measures might do better. Chronologically ordered causal diagrams, once more, disclose imperatives for data collection. They underscore the need to devise and use measurement tools that minimise error. They encourage us not to blindly adhere to psychometric tradition and to instead contemplate causality in the context of the question at hand.

### Review

If Cicero were among us, he might proclaim: *"Structuralis Ante Causal!"* --- place the structural before the causal!

In the human sciences, statistical models hold sway. The attention they receive is understandable, given the vital role statistics play in providing quantitative insights, including those into causation. However, when our goal is to quantitatively estimate the causal effects of interventions, the structural approach takes precedence. Statistics remain crucial, but they follow later.

Posing a causal question requires well-defined exposures and outcomes, which are precisely measured over time. Identification and baseline measurement of confounders is crucial. Causal diagrams, developed with area experts, assist us in this process. If data collection is required - which is often the case for original research - our work has just begun. Considering the inherent issues of sampling coverage, sample size, and longitudinal retention, data collection becomes a marathon, rather than just a step in a race. This task demands both accuracy and relentless attention.

Causal inference, then, involves more than just fitting models to data, despite the importance of this aspect. Furthermore, the statistical models that a rigorous counterfactual data science mandates may be unfamiliar territory for many in the human sciences. Embracing these demands requires deliberate effort.

Causal inference, then, is demanding. The endeavour is not meant for the timid. However, it is worth the commitment because it brings us closer to a quantitative understanding of causation. This understanding resonates with the natural curiosity and interests of most human scientists, even though we have frequently settled for correlations. In this discussion, I have demonstrated how chronologically ordered causal diagrams can enrich counterfactual data science. We have seen that their value extends beyond modelling; they are superb guides for data collection. When employed judiciously, causal diagrams can bolster our pursuit of a robust causal understanding.

### How to use causal diagrams judiciously

1.  **Clearly define all variables on the graph.**

2.  **Clearly define any novel conventions in your causal diagram**.

3.  **Ensure the graph is acyclic:** a node cannot be its own ancestor, which ensures no circular paths exist within the graph.

4.  **Time-stamp nodes**: causation transpires over time, causal diagrams benefit when the unfolding of time is visually evident.

5.  **Maintain chronological order**: arrange nodes in temporal sequence, generally from left to right or top to bottom. The sequence of events should be evident in the spatial layout. However, it is rarely necessary to draw that sequence to scale.

6.  **Embrace minimalism**: include only those nodes and edges as are essential for clarifying the identification problem. Refrain from cluttering the causal diagram.

7.  **Show vectors for unmeasured confounding**: plan for sensitivity analyses to assess whether unmeasured confounding might explain away results.

8.  **Show nodes for post-treatment selection**: this helps to understand potential sources of selection bias.

9.  **Should mediation or interaction be of interest, extend the graphs to clarify the relevant structures of bias**: but do not attempt to draw non-linear associations between the variables on your graph.

10. **Appreciate causal diagrams are qualitative tools that encode assumptions about causal ancestries**: causal diagrams are akin to compasses that guide us to close backdoor paths. We should refrain from using them as exhaustive atlases for reality.

11. **Show vectors of correlated and/or directed measurement error**: where such vectors may be assumed to create compromising bias.

12. **Distinguish between structural models, and structural equation models**: Causal diagrams are structural (causal) models. Despite terminology, structural equation models are tools for statistical analysis. We should refer to them as "correlational equation models." The coefficients derived from correlational equation models typically lack causal interpretations. It is difficult to imagine scenarios in which they should be reported. Our prior discussions of mediation and treatment-confounder feedback revealed foils for causal inference in would, on the face of it, seemed to be simple scenarios. G-methods offer powerful solutions for causal estimation in such scenarios. Despite their efficacy, however, many in the evolutionary human sciences have yet to adopt G-methods them.

### Concluding remarks

Causal inference is essential for science because it offers a way to quantify the effects of interventions. However, it is only a small part of science. Particularly in the historical sciences, the fundamental assumptions of causal inference may not be applicable. We should not abandon sciences that do not quantify causal effect estimates.

That said, many human scientists have yet to adopt causal inferential approaches. In most fields, the correlational methods that have held sway and still hold sway. We are a long way from overstating the importance of causal inference.

Chronologically ordered causal diagrams highlight the necessity of time-series data for answering quantitative causal questions. The demand for time-series data collection in causal inference brings substantial implications for research design, funding models, and the pace of scientific discovery. A three-year panel design, accounting for research preparation, data collection, and data entry, would require at least five years of support. However, prevailing funding models often only provide for 2-3 years.\
Suppose a human scientist is willing to undertake the heavy commitment required to investigate causality. Who will support their work?

Most human scientists want to understand the effects of interventions on the world. Nevertheless, scientific progress is contingent on our institutional capacity to transition from a productivity model reminiscent of an assembly line or counterfeit money press to a system that nurtures long-term data collection.

## Appendix 1: Review of VanderWeele's theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment

We denote an average causal effect as the change in the expected potential outcomes when all units receive one level of treatment compared to another.

Let $\delta$ denote the causal estimand on the difference scale $(\mathbb{E}[Y^1 - Y^0])$. The causal effect identification can be expressed as:

$$ \delta = \sum_l \left( \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a,l] - \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a^*,l] \right) P(l)$$

The theory of causal inference with multiple treatment versions provides a conceptual framework for causal inference in observational studies. Suppose we can assume that for each treatment version, the outcome under that version equals the observed outcome when that version is administered, conditional on baseline covariates and satisfaction of other assumptions. In that case, we can consistently estimate causal contrasts, even when treatments vary.

This approach interprets treatment indicator $A$ as multiple actual treatment versions $K$. Furthermore, if we can assume conditional independence, meaning there is no confounding for the effect of $K$ on $Y$ given $L$, we have: $Y(k)\coprod A|K,L$.

This condition implies that, given $L$, $A$ adds no additional information about $Y$ after accounting for $K$ and $L$. If $Y = Y(k)$ for $K = k$ and $Y(k)$ is independent of $K$, conditional on $L$, we can interpret $A$ as a simplified indicator of $K$ [@vanderweele2013]. This scenario is depicted in @fig-dag_multiple_version_treatment_dag.

With the necessary assumptions in place, we can derive consistent causal effects. The causal effect can be expressed

$$\delta = \sum_{k,l} \left( \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a,l) P(l) - \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a^*,l) P(l) \right) $$

This setup is akin to a randomised trial where individuals, stratified by covariate $L$, are assigned a treatment version $K$. This assignment comes from the distribution of $K$ for the $(A = 1, L = l)$ subset. The control group receives a randomly assigned $K$ version from the $(A = 0, L = l)$ distribution.

```

This theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment is advantageous when treatments exhibit significant variability [@vanderweele2013]. In Part 5, I explored VanderWeele's application of this theory (which he developed) to latent factor models, where the presumption of a single underlying reality for the items that constitute constructs can be challenged [@vanderweele2022]. Furthermore, I described additional complications not addressed by this theory extension arising from measurement error. Specifically, the possibility that directed or correlated error terms for the exposure and outcome could undermine inference.
