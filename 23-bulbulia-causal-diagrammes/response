> The editorial team is also keen to banish all acronyms from the pages of the journal, and I in particular take an especially rigid stance on this point.  Evolutionary Human Sciences is, as you know, an unapologetically interdisciplinary journal.  As such, all authors accept an extra burden to communicate in an accessible fashion, and we suspect that acronyms rarely help with this task.  That's our working hypothesis at least.  So, please no acronyms (e.g. DAG), not even after introducing them.  Just write it out.


** Agreed. Done







-> Please think carefully about your notation, and emphasize consistency throughout.  I was, in particular, puzzled by the following points:

(a) i indexes culture, but you do not include indexing consistently, e.g. A versus A_i versus a versus a_i.  See p. 3, for example.
(b) The notation for treatment has the flavor of what we use for random variables.  Specifically, A_i might refer to the random variable, a_i might refer to an arbitrary realization, and {0,1} is the support or set of feasible realizations.  If you agree, I would expect to see A_i = a_i, A_i = 0, and A_i = 1.  I would not expect to see a_i = 0 or a_i = 1.  There's no fundamental point here.  Just explaining my reaction for you to consider when thinking about the potential for misunderstanding.  I had a quick look at Morgan and Winship just now, and my expectations w.r.t. the potential outcome framework are also consistent with their notation, though they use different variables than you


** To simplify I've adopted the convention of dropping subscripts unless they are needed. Agree notation gets confusing:

As Hernán and Robins note in *What If, "Sometimes we abbreviate the ex- pression “individual i has outcome Y a = 1 ” by writing Y a i = 1. Technically, when i refers to a specific individual, such as Zeus, Y a i is not a random variable because we are assuming that individual counter- factual outcomes are deterministic (see Technical Point 1.2)" p4.

I explain this in a new footnote.

-> p. 5. on Assumption 3.  I believe you want a little L to the immediate right of the conditional, not a big L. 

Added. Thank you.
