#| label: fig-dag-mediation-assumptions
#| fig-cap: "This causal diagram illustrates the four fundamental assumptions needed for causal mediation analysis. The first assumption pertains to the brown paths. It requires the absence of an unmeasured exposure-outcome confounder, and assumes that conditioning on L1 is sufficient for such confounding control. The second assumption pertains to the blue paths. It requires the absence of an unmeasured mediator-outcome confounder, and assumes that conditioning on L2 is sufficient for such confounding control. The third assumption pertains to the green paths. It requires the absence of an unmeasured exposure-mediator confounder, and assumes that conditioning on L3 is sufficient for such confounding control. The fourth and final assumption pertains to the red paths. It requires the absence of an a mediator-outcome confounder that is affected by the exposure, and assumes that there is no path from the exposure to L2 to M. If the exposure were to affect L2, then conditioning on L2 would block the exposure's effect on the mediator, as indicated by dashed red path. Causal diagrams not only clarify how different types of confounding bias may converge (here mediation bias and confounder bias), but also reveal the limitations of common methods such as structural equation models and multilevel models for handling time-series data where the fourth assumption fails -- that is, where there is treatment-confounder feedback. Such feedback is common in time-series data, but not widely understood. For example structural equation models and multi-level models cannot address causal questions in the presence of such feedback, but these models remain widely favoured."

Selection at the baseline stage induces correlations in the exposure and outcome measurement errors, shown by red paths. The figure underscores the importance of clearly defining the source populationand the target population; in many comparative studies, the source population cannot coherently map onto any coherent targe population. Reserachers will often do better to restrict generalisations within cultures." -->
