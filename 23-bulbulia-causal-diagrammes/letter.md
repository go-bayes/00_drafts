Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit a methods article for the forthcoming special issue on Causal Inference. The article offers a practical guide for building and implementing causal diagrams in the evolutionary human sciences.

Although it is encouraging that many researchers in evolutionary human sciences are attempting to use causal diagrams, the field would greatly benefit from clearer direction about building and applying them. For this reason, a comprehensive guide would appear timely. 

The guide starts by revisiting the foundational assumptions that underpin causal inference. Many applied researchers maintain only a surface-level understanding of these concepts. The demand for a greater understanding of the intellectual framework in which causal inference takes its life motivates a treatment that begins with the basics.

Subsequently, the guide uses causal diagrams to clarify three types of structural bias: (1) confounding bias, (2) selection bias, and (3) measurement bias. A section on data collection links graphical theory to its application. I emphasise the benefits of aligning a graph's spatial organisation with the inherent time sequence of causation. Not only does this emphasise help to clarify conditions for counterfactual identifiability, it also directs attention to mission-critical imperatives for data collection.

The article is comprehensive, with approximately 20,000 words in the main text, 32 figures, and 75 references. I have trimmed the content where possible. However, a detailed guide is needed to substantially improve the quantitative analysis of causation in the Evolutionary Human Sciences. For this reason, I would greatly appreciate your consideration of this article for publication in Evolutionary Human Sciences.

Sincerely, 

Joseph Bulbulia
