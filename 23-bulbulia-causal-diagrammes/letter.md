Dear Editors, 

I am pleased to submit a commissioned methods article for the special issue on Causal Inference.

The article delivers essential clarification on the functions, purposes, and insights afforded by causal diagrams. It underscores the vital matter of temporal order in examining causation, illustrating how aligning a causal diagram's spatial structure with the temporal sequence of causation can clarify data collection and modelling.

Moreover, it offers guidelines for practical data collection and modelling informed by causal diagrams, that promise to advance our field's research methodology. It also grapples with the issue of selection bias within a three-wave panel design, an area warranting deeper consideration and work. Finally, the article investigates threats to causal estimation arising from correlated and directed measurement error, a topic particularly relevant to comparative cultural research.

Given the present gap in understanding of causal inference, there was a need to build from first principles. The length of the article and the number of figures, albeit greater than typical for the journal, are justified. The 18,847 words and 30 figures offer rich insight and detail, which I believe the field urgently requires.

In summary, the article delivers a thorough, step-by-step explanation of critical assumptions, concepts, and challenges in causal inference. It extends from basic foundational principles to more intricate issues of confounding, mediation, longitudinal growth, selection bias, and measurement bias. This comprehensive approach is necessary to enhance attempts at quantitative evaluation of causation in the Evolutionary Human Sciences. 

Thank you very much for your consideration. 

All best wishes,
