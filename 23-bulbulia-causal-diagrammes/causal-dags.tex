\begin{abstract}
Causation occurs in time. However, quantifying causal effects requires
conceptualising an unobserved counterfactual. Here, I demonstrate the
value of aligning a causal diagram's spatial structure with the assumed
temporal order of causation. A clear focus on the assumptions required
for counterfactual identifiability must also be maintained.
Collectively, these strategies substantially enhance a graph's utility,
revealing imperatives for data collection and modelling. Part 1 revisits
the three fundamental assumptions of causal inferences. Part 2 discusses
confounding and uses chronologically ordered causal diagrams to
elucidate causal interaction, mediation, and longitudinal growth. Part 3
demonstrates the practical insights time-structured diagrams bring to
data collection and modelling. Part 4 applies causal diagrams to
selection bias in a three-wave panel, revealing the importance of proper
sampling, retention, and handling of missing data. Finally, Part 5
employs chronologically ordered causal diagrams to discuss threats to
causal estimation from measurement error, specifically in comparative
cultural research.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Correlation is not causation. However, persistent confusion in the
analysis and reporting of correlations has limited scientific progress
across many human sciences. The direction of causation frequently runs
opposite to the direction of manifest correlations. This problem is
widely known. Nevertheless, many human scientists report manifest
correlations using hedging language. Making matters worse, widely
adopted strategies for confounding control fail
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcelreath2020}{McElreath 2020}), suggesting a
``causality crisis'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-bulbulia2022}{J. A.
Bulbulia 2022}). Addressing the causality crisis is among the human
science's most pressing tasks.

When integrated into methodologically rigorous workflows, causal
Directed Acyclic Graphs (``DAGs'' or ``causal diagrams'') can be
powerful tools for clarifying causality.\footnote{The term ``DAG'' is
  somewhat misleading because not all directed acyclic graphs represent
  causal structures. For a graph to embody a causal structure, it must
  satisfy the conditions of the Markov factorisation property (see: Part
  2).} A system of formal mathematical proofs underpins their design.
This quality brings confidence. No formal mathematical training is
required to use them. This quality makes them accessible. However,
causal inference relies on assumptions. Causal diagrams are methods for
encoding such assumptions. Where assumptions are unwarranted, causal
diagrams may deceive. For example, when researchers lack time-series
data, causal effect estimates are generally unwarranted: causal diagrams
should not be used. Ideally, however, causal diagrams would serve as
circuit breakers that halt such misapplications.

Here, I introduce a suite of techniques for constructing causal diagrams
that improve their utility. The core of this advice is to develop
\emph{chronologically ordered causal diagrams} -- that is, causal
diagrams in which the temporal order of cause and effect is evident in
the graph's spatial layout and its labelling of the nodes. I then
illustrate the application of chronologically ordered causal diagrams
for research design in evolutionary human science.

There are many excellent introductions to causal diagrams
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rohrer2018}{Rohrer 2018};

  course, here:
  \url{https://pll.harvard.edu/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-your-conclusions}.}
One may reasonably ask whether another introduction adds clutter. The
approach I present here hopes to add value in five ways.

\textbf{Part 1} introduces the counterfactual framework for causal
inference as the appropriate theoretical setting for developing causal
diagrams. Here, I review the three fundamental identification
assumptions required for causal inference.

\textbf{Part 2} discusses the four primary forms of confounding. Here, I
introduce chronologically ordered causal diagrams. I explain how
temporal ordering brings clarity and direction to data collection and
modelling. I explain how chronologically ordered causal diagrams
illuminate the topics of causal interaction, causal mediation, and
longitudinal growth modelling in settings of treatment-confounder
feedback.

\textbf{Part 3} discusses the advantages of collecting repeated measures
data for at least three waves, benefits that chronologically ordered
causal diagrams make evident. This discussion of the three-wave panel
provides practical guidance for human evolutionary scientists interested
in recording history, as it is occurring in the present, to obtain a
quantitative causal understanding for their questions.

\textbf{Part 4} discusses selection bias in a three-wave panel. Here, I
use chronologically ordered causal diagrams to demonstrate the
mission-critical importance for causal estimation of adequate sampling
and longitudinal retention.

\textbf{Part 5} uses causal diagrams to clarify four types of
measurement bias that arise when addressing causal questions. This
section will particularly interest researchers in comparative cultural
research, and researchers who employ composite scales.

Throughout this study, it is the application of chronologically ordered
causal diagrams in the setting of counterfactual data science that
illuminates both effective research strategies and their limitations.

\subsection{Part 1. The Three Fundamental Identifiability Assumptions of
Causal
Inference}\label{part-1.-the-three-fundamental-identifiability-assumptions-of-causal-inference}}

Before we can answer causal questions, we must understand how to ask
them (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2016}{Miguel A. Hernán et al.
2016a}). In this section I review the three fundamental identification
assumptions required for causal inference.

\hypertarget{the-fundamental-problem-of-causal-inference}{%
\subsubsection{The fundamental problem of causal
inference}\label{the-fundamental-problem-of-causal-inference}}

We are entitled to claim that \(A\) causes \(Y\) if altering \(A\) would
have influenced the outcome of \(Y\)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hume1902}{Hume 1902};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lewis1973}{Lewis 1973}). This claim requires
counterfactual reasoning. The causal effect is conceived as a contrast
between the world as it is, and the world as it could have been. Our
objective in causal inference is to quantify the magnitude of such
contrasts.

Consider an observed correlation between cultural beliefs in Big Gods
and social complexity. Suppose we hope to quantify the magnitude of the
causal effect of such beliefs. Denote beliefs in Big Gods, the
``exposure'' or ``treatment,'' by \(A\). Denote social complexity, the
outcome, by \(Y\). For now, assume the exposure, outcome, and the units
on which the exposures and outcomes are measured, ``cultures,'' are
well-defined. (We will revisit these assumptions shortly.)

To evaluate causality for any individual culture, we must establish two
counterfactual or ``potential'' outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(Y_i(a = 1)\): The social complexity of culture \(i\) under belief in
  Big Gods. This outcome is counterfactual for each culture where
  \(A_i = 0\).
\item
  \(Y_i(a = 0)\): The social complexity of culture \(i\) without belief
  in Big Gods. This outcome is counterfactual for each culture where
  \(A_i = 1\).\footnote{The counterfactual outcome under exposure
    \(A = a\) can be denoted in several ways, such as \(Y(a)\),
    \(Y^{a}\), and \(Y_a\), with \(Y(a)\) being our chosen notation. For
    simplicity, we assume the exposures are exhaustive.}
\end{itemize}

We can define a causal effect of belief in Big Gods on social complexity
for a given culture as the difference between potential outcomes
\(Y_i(a)\) under \emph{each} exposure level, (\(A_i = 1\) and
\(A_i = 0\)).

\[
\text{Causal Effect of Belief in Big Gods}_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) 
\]

To determine causality, then, we require a contrast between two states
of the world, one of which is inevitably counterfactual. Each individual
causal effect is not identified in the data. This is known as ``the
fundamental problem of causal inference''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rubin1976}{Rubin 1976};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-holland1986}{Holland 1986}). Inferring
counterfactual contrasts -- which is required for quantitative causal
estimates -- thus becomes a special, elusive, \emph{missing data
problem} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-westreich2015}{Westreich et al. 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-edwards2015}{Edwards, Cole, and Westreich 2015}).

\hypertarget{causal-inference-is-an-approach-for-estimating-average-marginal-causal-effects}{%
\paragraph{Causal inference is an approach for estimating average
(marginal) causal
effects}\label{causal-inference-is-an-approach-for-estimating-average-marginal-causal-effects}}

Individual-level causal effects are typically unobservable. However,
under certain conditions we may use observable data to estimate average
causal effects between exposure conditions when certain assumptions are
satisfied. To obtain these effects on the difference scale, we must
compute a difference in average outcomes (or equivalently, the average
of the differences in outcomes) from units exposed to different
treatment levels. In the case of a binary exposure, this contrast is
between the average difference (or equivalently, the difference of the
averages) when (1) all units are exposed to a certain level of treatment
and (2) none are exposed.\footnote{Note that the difference in average
  expectations is equivalent to the average of the differences in
  expectations.}

On the difference scale, where \(a\) and \(a^*\) denote different levels
of treatment, this average treatment effect (ATE) is given by the
expression

\[
ATE = E[Y(a)] - E[Y(a^*)]
\]

However, we have just said that each unit may receive only one level of
the exposure, \(A_i = a\) or \(A_i = a^*\), and that as such
individual-level causal effects are generally not identifiable. Because
the treatment groups are composed of individual units, the treatment
groups will also contain missing observations. Where \(\delta\) denotes
the average treatment effect, the problem can be expressed

\[
\delta = \bigg(E[Y(1)|A = 1]_{\text{observed}} + E[Y(1)|A = 0]_{\text{unobserved}}\bigg) - \bigg(E[Y(0)|A = 0]_{\text{observed}}  + E[Y(0)|A = 1]_{\text{unobserved}}\bigg)
\]

Causal inference is a framework of assumptions and methods for deriving
causal contrasts from observed or observable data. This is why we may
call it \emph{counterfactual data science.} To effectively use causal
diagrams, it is essential to comprehend their role within this broader
framework.

\hypertarget{identification-assumption-1-causal-consistency}{%
\subsubsection{Identification Assumption 1: Causal
Consistency}\label{identification-assumption-1-causal-consistency}}

The causal consistency assumption plays a pivotal role in addressing
that special, elusive, \emph{missing data problem} at the foundation of
each causal question. Let \(Y_i^{observed}|A_i\) denote an individual's
observed outcome in response to treatment. Where the causal consistency
assumption is satisfied, we may derive counterfactual outcomes from the
following rule:

\[
Y_i^{observed}|A = 
\begin{cases} 
Y_i(~a^*) & \text{if } A_i = a* \\
Y_i(~a~) & \text{if } A_i = a
\end{cases}
\]

Where the causal consistency assumption is satisfied, we can state that
the observed outcome, given an individual's actual exposure, matches
that individual's counterfactual outcome under the same exposure.
Although this equivalence provides up to half of the counterfactual
outcomes required to compute causal contrasts. When met, the
counterfactual consistency assumption provides this essential connection
bridges from observed outcomes to counterfactual outcomes. Although this
bridge only takes us halfway to acquiring the full range of
counterfactual outcomes needed to identify average treatment effects, it
marks a significant beginning.

It is possible to make a further distinction within the consistency.

\textbf{No interference assumption (also known as SUTVA - Stable Unit
Treatment Value Assumption)}: the potential outcome for unit \(i\) under
treatment \(a_i\) is independent of the treatment assignment of any
other unit \(j\). Formally we may express this independence

\[
Y_i(A=a_i, A=a_j) = Y_i(A=a_i, A=a'_j)
\]

for all \(a_i, a'_j\). Thus, if the treatment received by any unit \(j\)
(\(A=a_j\) or \(A=a'_j\)) does not affect the potential outcome of unit
\(i\) when \(A=a_i\), we say that the potential outcome for unit \(i\)
under treatment \(a_i\) satisfies the no interference assumption.
Violations of this condition can occur when there are dependencies in
the data such as social network effects. For example, the efficacy of a
vaccine may depend on the frequency of vaccination in the population,
violating the non-interference assumption
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ogburn2022}{Ogburn et al. 2022};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-murray2021}{Murray, Marshall, and Buchanan
2021a}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-murray2021a}{2021b})

**The theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment
derives from a proof that the causal consistency assumption does not
strictly require homogeneity of treatment administrations*. VanderWeele
showed that under the theory of causal inference under multiple
exposures, where there are \(K\) different versions of treatment \(A\),
we may consistently estimate causal effects under the assumptions of
``treatment variation irrelevance''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2009}{Tyler J. VanderWeele 2009}).
More specifically, we may claim such an entitlement to the causal
consistency assumption if the effects of the variations of the treatment
are independent of the counterfactual outcomes under such treatments,
that is, if there is no confounding for \(K\)'s effect on \(Y\) given
measured confounders \(L\) such that

\[
K \coprod Y(k) | L
\]

or equivalently

\[
Y(k) \coprod K | L
\]

According to the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of
treatment, the measured variable \(A\) functions as a ``coarsened
indicator'' for estimating the causal effect of the multiple versions of
treatment \(K\) on \(Y(k)\)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2009}{Tyler J. VanderWeele 2009},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2018}{2018};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2013}{Tyler J. VanderWeele and Hernan
2013}). (See Appendix 1 for additional discussion of the proof and its
implications.)

\textbf{The theory of causal inference under multiple versions of
treatment has limited application}: the ``treatment variation
irrelevance'' that we require to assume causal consistency can be
difficult to assess in practice because the \(K\) treatment versions in
our data may not be well-defined. This is important because to assess
the conditional independence assumption (described below) we must
understand the set of interventions upon which the units of treatment
are meant to be exchangeable. When defining treatments and outcomes for
estimating causal effects, we must clearly state the hypothetical
interventions and specific outcomes to which they apply. In practice,
the symbol \(K\) m️ight denote little more than our ignorance. I will
return to this topic in Part 4 (see:
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2022a}{Miguel A. Hernán, Wang, and Leaf
2022a}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-murray2021a}{Murray, Marshall, and
Buchanan 2021b}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2008}{Miguel A. Hernán
et al. 2008}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-bulbulia2022}{J. A. Bulbulia
2022}).\footnote{see Appendix 1 for a more detailed explanation of the
  theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment.}

\hypertarget{identification-assumption-2-conditional-exchangeability}{%
\subsubsection{Identification Assumption 2: (Conditional)
Exchangeability}\label{identification-assumption-2-conditional-exchangeability}}

The (conditional) exchangeability assumption refers to the treatment
assignment mechanism. It holds if, upon conditioning on observed
covariates, the treatment assignment is independent of the potential
outcomes under treatment. Conceptually, assuming both causal consistency
(including SUTVA) and positivity are satisfied, exchangeability implies
that if units were swapped between treatment conditions, the
distribution of potential outcomes under different exposures would
remain unchanged. This assumption is needed to ensure a balance between
exposures in confounders that might affect the outcome. With this
assumption satisfied, the counterfactual observations derived from the
consistency and positivity assumptions can be viewed as randomly
assigned to the exposure conditions under which they were observed. In
effect (as it were), satisfying the conditional exchangeability
assumption is an attempt to simulate experimentally controlled
randomisation with observational data.

Let \(L\) to be the set of measured covariates required to ensure
conditional independence. Let \(\coprod\) denote independence. We
express the exchangeability of counterfactual outcomes conditional on
measured covariates \(L\) as

\[
Y(a) \coprod  A|L \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad A \coprod  Y(a)|L
\]

Where the exchangeability assumption holds, along with the consistency
and positivity assumptions, we may express the average treatment effect
(ATE) on the difference scale

\[
ATE = E[Y(a^*)|L = l] - E[Y(a)|L = l]
\]

\textbf{It is essential to understand that causal diagrams were
developed to evaluate the conditional exchangeability assumption.}

Although causal diagrams can be helpful for assessing the causal
consistency assumption and the positivity assumption (no deterministic
arrows), their primary utility lies in clarifying the requirements of
conditional exchangeability (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023}{M. A.
Hernán and Robins 2023a}). Keeping this primary function in mind helps
to avoid misapplications of the tool, such as interpreting (so-called)
structural equation models as causal diagrams, or attempting to
represent non-linear relationships in the graph. (We will revisit these
potential misuses later.)

\hypertarget{identification-assumption-3-positivity}{%
\subsubsection{Identification Assumption 3:
Positivity}\label{identification-assumption-3-positivity}}

The positivity assumption is satisfied if there is a non-zero
probability of receiving or not receiving the exposure within each level
of all covariates. In other words, within every stratum of every
covariate, the probability of each exposure value must be greater than
zero. Mathematically:

\[
0 < \Pr(A=a|L)<1, ~ \forall a \in A, ~ \forall l \in L
\]

Causal inference encounters challenges without the satisfaction of the
positivity assumption, as the envisioning of causal contrasts hinges on
the potential for randomised assignment to interventions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-westreich2010}{Westreich and Cole 2010}).

There are two types of positivity violations.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Random non-positivity}: this refers to situations where the
  exposure is conceivable, yet some potential observations, while
  theoretically possible, are absent within our data. This situation
  often arises with continuous exposures, where certain realisations
  along the number line are naturally missing due to its infinite
  nature. Despite this, it remains possible to employ statistical models
  to estimate causal contrasts. Notably, random non-positivity is the
  only identifiability assumption that can be checked using data.
\item
  \textbf{Deterministic non-positivity:} this refers to situations where
  the exposures are impossible or inconceivable. A classical example is
  the impossibility of a hysterectomy in biological males.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{the-difficulty-of-satisfying-the-three-fundamental-assumptions-of-causal-inference-when-asking-causal-questions-of-history}{%
\subsubsection{The difficulty of satisfying the three fundamental
assumptions of causal inference when asking causal questions of
history}\label{the-difficulty-of-satisfying-the-three-fundamental-assumptions-of-causal-inference-when-asking-causal-questions-of-history}}

Consider the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, which initiated
religious change throughout much of Europe. Historians have variously
argued that Protestantism caused social, cultural, and economic changes
in those societies where it took hold (see:
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-weber1905}{Weber 1905},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-weber1993}{1993};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-swanson1967}{Guy E. Swanson 1967};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-swanson1971}{Guy E. Swanson 1971};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-basten2013}{Basten and Betz 2013}), for an
overview see: (\protect\hyperlink{ref-becker2016}{Becker, Pfaff, and
Rubin 2016})).

Suppose we are interested in estimating the ``Average Treatment Effect''
of the Protestant Reformation. Let \(A = a^*\) denote the adoption of
Protestantism. We compare this effect with that of remaining Catholic,
represented as \(A = a\). We assume that both the concepts of ``adopting
Protestantism'' and of ``economic development'' are well-defined
(e.g.~GDP +1 century after a country has a Protestant majority
contrasted with remaining Catholic). The causal effect for any
individual country is \(Y_i(a^*) - Y_i(a)\). Although we cannot identify
this effect, if the basic assumptions of causal inference are met, we
can estimate the average or marginal effect as

\[\frac{1}{n} \left[\sum_i^{n} Y_i(a^*) - \sum_i^{n} Y_i(a)\right],\]

which, conditioning the confounding effects of \(L\) gives us

\[ATE_{\textnormal{economic~development}} = E[Y(\textnormal{Became~Protestant}|L) - Y(\textnormal{Remained~Catholic}|L)]\]

When asking the question about the economic effect of adopting
Protestantism versus remaining Catholic, there are indeed several
challenges that arise in relation to the three fundamental assumptions
required for causal inference.

\textbf{Causal Consistency}: This assumption implies that the outcome
under each level of exposure is well-defined. In this context, defining
what ``adopting Protestantism'' and ``remaining Catholic'' mean may
present challenges. The practices and beliefs associated with each
religion might vary significantly across countries and time periods, and
it may be difficult to create a consistent, well-defined exposure.
Furthermore, the outcome - economic development - may also be
challenging to measure consistently across different countries and time
periods.

There is undoubtedly considerable heterogeneity in the ``Protestant
exposure.'' In England, Protestantism was closely tied to the monarchy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-collinson2007}{Collinson 2007}). In Germany,
Martin Luther's teachings emphasised individual faith in scripture,
which, it has been claimed, supported economic development by promoting
literacy (\protect\hyperlink{ref-gawthrop1984}{Gawthrop and Strauss
1984}). In England, King Henry VIII abolished Catholicism
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-collinson2007}{Collinson 2007}). The
Reformation, then, occurred differently in different places. The
exposure needs to be better-defined.

There is also ample scope for interference: 16th century societies were
interconnected through trade, diplomacy, and warfare. Thus, the
religious decisions of one society were unlikely to have been
independent from those of other societies.

\textbf{Exchangeability}: this assumption implies that given the
confounders, the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment
assignment. It might be difficult to account for all possible
confounders in this context. For example, historical, political, social,
and geographical factors could influence both a country's religious
affiliations and its economic development. If these factors are not
properly controlled, it could lead to confounding bias.

\textbf{Positivity}:tThis assumption requires that there is a non-zero
probability of every level of exposure for every strata of confounders.
If we consider various confounding factors such as geographical
location, historical events, or political circumstances, some countries
might only ever have the possibility of either remaining Catholic or
becoming Protestant, but not both. For example, it is unclear under
which conditions 16th century Spain could have been randomly assigned to
Protestantism (\protect\hyperlink{ref-nalle1987}{Nalle 1987}).

Perhaps a more credible measure of effect in the region of our interests
is the Average Treatment Effect in the Treated (ATT) expressed

\[ATT = E[(Y(a*)- Y(a))|A = a*,L]\]

Here, the ATT defines the expected difference in economic success for
cultures that became Protestant compared with the expected economic
success if those cultures had not become Protestant, conditional on
measured confounders \(L\), among the exposed (\(A = a^*\)). To estimate
this contrast, our models would need to match Protestant cultures with
comparable Catholic cultures effectively. By estimating the ATT, we
would avoid the assumption of non-deterministic positivity for the
untreated. However, whether matching is conceptually plausible remains
for historians and philosophers. It would seem that assigning a religion
to a culture a religion is not as easy as administering a pill
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-watts2018}{Watts et al. 2018}).

\hypertarget{summary-part-1}{%
\subsubsection{Summary Part 1}\label{summary-part-1}}

To quantify causal effects requires converting observations into causal
contrasts. Causation itself, however, is never directly observed.
Obtaining causal contrasts from data requires assumptions. The three
fundamental assumptions of causal inference are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Causal Consistency}: the exposure values under comparison map
  onto well-defined interventions found in the data
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023}{M. A. Hernán and Robins 2023a})
  (see also: Chatton et al.
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-chatton2020}{2020})).
\item
  \textbf{Exchangeability}: the potential outcomes under all exposure
  levels are independent of the actual exposure level, once we have
  adjusted for measured covariates
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023}{M. A. Hernán and Robins
  2023a}).
\item
  \textbf{Positivity:} the probability of receiving every exposure value
  within all strata of covariates exceeds zero
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023}{M. A. Hernán and Robins
  2023a}).
\end{enumerate}

Causal diagrams predominantly assist in evaluating the (conditional)
exchangeability assumption, an integral component of the counterfactual
data science framework. This assumption forms part of a more
comprehensive framework of counterfactual data science, a science that
is concerned with deriving insights from marginal contrasts of
hypothetical scenarios from from partial observations.

In this discussion, we have emphasised that:

\textbf{Under conditions of positivity, the counterfactual consistency
assumption yields half of the requisite counterfactual outcomes for
inferring causal contrasts. Exchangeability supplies the remaining
half.}

Diagrams}\label{part-2.-chronologically-ordered-causal-diagrams}}

\hypertarget{background-concepts-and-conventions}{%
\subsubsection{Background: Concepts and
Conventions}\label{background-concepts-and-conventions}}

Causal diagrams, in their contemporary form, were developed by Judea
Pearl. Their purpose is to assist researchers in identifying the
conditions under which causal effects can be discerned from data
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl1995}{Pearl 1995},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl2009}{2009a};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-greenland1999}{Greenland, Pearl, and Robins
1999}).

To use causal diagrams, we must understand the following concepts and
conventions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Nodes and edges}: nodes represent variables or events within a
  causal system, while edges signify relationships or interactions
  between these variables.
\item
  \textbf{Directed and undirected edges}: directed edges, depicted as
  arrows, signify an assumed causal link from one variable to another.
  In contrast, undirected edges, which lack arrows, signify an assumed
  association exists but no direct causal link is implied. These edges
  in a causal diagram indicate potential avenues of influence between
  nodes.
\item
  \textbf{Ancestors and descendants}: we call a variable an ``ancestor''
  if it directly or indirectly influences another variable. Conversely,
  we call a variable a ``descendant'' if it is influenced, directly or
  indirectly, by another variable.
\item
  \textbf{D-separation}: we call a path ``blocked'', or ``d-separated'',
  if a node along it prevents the transmission of influence. Two
  variables are considered d-separated if all paths between them are
  blocked; otherwise, they are d-connected
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl1995}{Pearl 1995}).
\end{enumerate}

Pearl showed that the principles of d-separation enable us to evaluate
relationships between nodes in a causal diagram (also known as a
``Directed Acyclic Graph'' or ``causal
DAG'')(\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl1995}{Pearl 1995}).

The d-separation rules are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Chain rule}: in a chain structure, where three variables are
  connected sequentially as \(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C\), \(B\)
  d-separates \(A\) and \(C\) when it is conditioned upon.
\item
  \textbf{Fork rule}: in a fork structure, where \(B\) is a common cause
  of both \(A\) and \(C\), i.e., \(A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C\), \(B\)
  d-separates \(A\) and \(C\) when it is conditioned upon.
\item
  \textbf{Collider rule}: in a collider structure, where \(B\) is a
  common effect of both \(A\) and \(C\), i.e.,
  \(A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C\), \(B\) d-separates \(A\) and \(C\)
  when it is neither conditioned upon nor is any of \(B\)'s descendants.
\end{enumerate}

In each case, if \(B\) fails to d-separate \(A\) and \(C\), \(A\) and
\(C\) are considered d-connected given \(B\), suggesting an open path
between \(A\) and \(C\). If all paths between \(A\) and \(C\) are
blocked (i.e., no path remains open), then \(A\) and \(C\) are
d-separated given a set of conditioning variables
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl2009}{Pearl 2009a}).

The rules of d-separation clarify which variables to adjust for when
estimating causal effects: we seek a set of variables that d-separates
the exposure from the outcome. By conditioning on this adjustment set,
we block all confounding paths, leaving only the causal effect
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl2009}{Pearl 2009a}).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item
  \textbf{Adjustment set}: a collection of variables that we either
  condition upon or deliberately avoid conditioning upon to block all
  backdoor paths between the exposure and the outcome in the causal
  diagram. This act reduces confounding bias
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl2009}{Pearl 2009a}).
\item
  \textbf{Confounders}: a member of an adjustment set. Importantly,
  \emph{we call a variable as a ``confounder'' in relation to a specific
  adjustment set.}
\item
  \textbf{Control of confounding by the Modified Disjunctive Cause
  Criterion}: VanderWeele's Modified Disjunctive Cause Criterion
  provides practical guidance for controlling for confounding. According
  to this criterion, any set of variables that can reduce or remove the
  distortion caused by confounding is deemed a member of a confounder
  set (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2019}{Tyler J. VanderWeele
  2019}). VanderWeele's strategy for defining a confounder set is as
  follows:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Control for any variable that causes the exposure, the outcome, or
  both.
\item
  Control for any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a shared
  cause of both exposure and outcome.
\item
  Define an instrumental variable as a variable associated with the
  exposure but does not influence the outcome independently, except
  through the exposure. Exclude any instrumental variable that is not a
  proxy for an unmeasured confounder from the confounder set.
\end{enumerate}

Note that a ``confounder set'' is a broader concept than that of an
``adjustment set.'' Every adjustment set is a member of a counfer set.
So the strategy will eliminate confounding when the data permit.
However, VanderWeel's strategy also reduces confounding in cases where
it cannot be eliminated.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\item
  \textbf{Compatibility}: the joint distribution of the variables
  satisfies the conditional independencies implied by the graph, we say
  it is compatible with the graph
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl 2009b}).
\item
  \textbf{Faithfulness}: if the conditional independencies in the data
  are captured by the graph, and conversely, if the dependencies
  suggested by the graph appear in the dat, we say the graph is faithful
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl1995a}{Pearl and Robins
  1995}).\footnote{While faithfulness or ``weak faithfulness'' allows
    for the possibility that some of the independences in the data might
    occur by coincidence (i.e., due to a cancellation of different
    effects), strong faithfulness does not. Under the strong
    faithfulness assumption, any independence observed in the data is
    assumed to correspond to a lack of direct causal relationship
    between the variables in question. Thus, if two variables are
    observed to be independent given a third variable in the data, it is
    assumed that there is no direct causal path between those two
    variables that is not mediated by the third variable. The strong
    faithfulness condition assumes that the observed data's statistical
    relationships directly reflect the underlying causal structure, with
    no independence relationships arising purely by coincidental
    cancellations. This is a stronger assumption than (weak)
    faithfulness and is often more practical in real-world applications
    of causal inference. Note that the faithfulness assumption (whether
    weak or strong) is not testable by observed data -- it is an
    assumption about the relationship between the observed data and the
    underlying causal structure.}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\item
  \textbf{Markov factorisation}: pertains to the relationship between
  the structure of a causal diagram and the distribution of variables it
  represents. Essentially, Markov factorisation allows us to express the
  joint distribution of all variables as a product of simpler,
  conditional distributions. According to this principle, each variable
  in the diagram depends directly only on its parent variables and is
  independent of others. This simplification allows us to graphically
  represent complex relationships between multiple variables in a causal
  system (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lauritzen1990}{Lauritzen et al. 1990};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl1988}{Pearl 1988}). Causal diagrams are
  powerful because under their hood is the engine of Markov
  factorisation.
\item
  \textbf{Backdoor criterion}: a set of conditions under which the
  effect of a treatment on an outcome can be obtained by controlling for
  a specific set of variables. The backdoor criterion guides the
  selection of \textbf{adjustment sets}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl1995}{Pearl 1995}).\footnote{Note there
    is also a Front-Door Criterion, which provides another way to
    estimate causal effects, even in the presence of unmeasured
    confounding variables. It relies on identifying a variable (or set
    of variables) that mediates the entire effect of the treatment on
    the outcome. The front-door criterion is rarely used in practice.}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}
\item
  \textbf{Identification problem}: the challenge of estimating the
  causal effect of a variable using observed data. Causal diagrams were
  developed to address the identification problem.
\item
  \textbf{Acyclic}: Causal diagrams must be acyclic -- they cannot
  contain feedback loops. More precisely: no variable can be an ancestor
  or descendant of itself. \emph{Therefore, in cases where repeated
  measurements are taken, nodes must be indexed by time.} As mentioned,
  repeated measures time series data are almost always required to
  estimate causal effects quantitatively. In Part 3 we consider how
  adding baseline measures of the outcome and exposure in a three-wave
  repeated measures design greatly enhances causal estimation
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl2009}{Pearl 2009a}). To represent the
  nodes of this design on a graph we must index them by time because the
  nodes are repeated.
\item
  \textbf{Total, direct and indirect effects}: in the presence of
  mediating variables, it is helpful to differentiate the total effect
  (the overall effect of a variable \(A\) on an outcome \(Y\)), direct
  effect (the effect of \(A\) on \(Y\) not via any mediator), and
  indirect effect (the effect of \(A\) on \(Y\) via mediator). We
  consider the assumptions of causal mediation below
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2015a}{T. VanderWeele 2015a}).
\item
  \textbf{Time-varying confounding}: we say there is time-varying
  confounding when a time-varying confounder is also a mediator in the
  causal pathway between exposure and outcome. Controlling for such a
  confounder could lead to bias. Longitudinal methods known as G-methods
  are typically required to handle time-varying confounding. We consider
  the challenge of time-varying confounding below
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023}{M. A. Hernán and Robins
  2023a}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{15}
\item
  \textbf{Statistical model:} a statistical model is a mathematical
  representation of the relationships between variables. It provides a
  framework to quantify how changes in one variable correspond with
  changes in others. For example, we discuss the \textbf{reflective
  latent factor model} in Part 5. This model posits that observable
  variables, or indicators, are influenced by an unobserved or latent
  variable. The relationship is typically expressed in a simplified form
  where each observed variable is a product of a ``factor loading'' and
  the latent variable, plus an error term. Importantly,
  \textbf{statistical models like the reflective latent factor model can
  correspond to multiple causal structures}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-wright1920}{Wright 1920},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-wright1923}{1923};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl2018}{Pearl and Mackenzie 2018};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023}{M. A. Hernán and Robins 2023a}).
\item
  \textbf{Structural model:} a structural model goes beyond a
  statistical model by integrating assumptions about causal
  relationships. Although statistical models capture relationships among
  variables, inferring causal relationships necessitates additional
  assumptions or information. Causal diagrams serve to graphically
  encode these assumptions, effectively representing the structural
  model (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023}{M. A. Hernán and Robins
  2023a}).
\end{enumerate}

What is the difference between statistical and structural models?
Statistical models quantify relationships, answering ``how much?'';
structural models clarify causality, addressing ``what if?'' The ``what
if?'' cannot be deduced from `how much?' because correlation does not
guarantee causation.

\hypertarget{variable-naming-conventions}{%
\paragraph{Variable Naming
Conventions}\label{variable-naming-conventions}}

\textbf{Outcome}. Denoted by \(Y\) below. The outcome, or ``effect,''
must be clearly defined. For instance, rather than stating ``the causal
effect of the Protestant Reformation on economic success,'' specify
``the +100 year effect on adjusted GDP after a country transitioned to a
Protestant majority.'' This clarity reveals limitations or challenges of
causal inference, such as conceptual incoherence, irrelevance, or data
deficiencies.

\textbf{Exposure or Treatment}. Denoted by \(A\) below. The exposure or
treatment also needs clear definition, and should not violate the
assumption of positivity. Understanding the intervention enables
accurate assessment of potential outcome variations under different
interventions.

\textbf{Measured Confounders}. Denoted by \(L\) below. These are
variables that, when part of a sufficient adjustment set, can reduce or
eliminate the non-causal association between exposure \(A\) and outcome
\(Y\).

\textbf{Unmeasured Confounders}. Denoted by \(U\) below. These are
confounding variables that remain unmeasured and may hinder the
d-separation of exposure and outcome. Unmeasured confounders may bias
causal estimates by creating spurious relationships between the exposure
and outcome.

\hypertarget{elemental-counfounds}{%
\subsubsection{Elemental counfounds}\label{elemental-counfounds}}

There are four elemental confounds
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcelreath2020}{McElreath 2020, 185}). Next, we
examine how employing chronological order in a causal diagram aids with
identification.

\hypertarget{the-problem-of-confounding-by-a-common-cause}{%
\subsubsection{1. The problem of confounding by a common
cause}\label{the-problem-of-confounding-by-a-common-cause}}

The problem of confounding by common cause arises when there is a
variable denoted by \(L\) that influences both the exposure, denoted by
\(A\) and the outcome, denoted by \(Y.\) Because \(L\) is a common cause
of \(A\) and \(Y\), \(L\) may create a statistical association between
\(A\) and \(Y\) that does not reflect a causal association. For example,
people who smoke may have yellow fingers. Suppose smoking causes cancer.
Because smoking (\(L\)) is a common cause of yellow fingers (\(A\)) and
cancer (\(Y\)), \(A\) and \(Y\) will be associated in the data. However,
intervening to change the colour of a person's fingers would not affect
cancer. There is confounding. The dashed red arrow in the graph
indicates bias arising from the open backdoor path from \(A\) to \(Y\)
that results from the common cause \(L\).

\subsubsection{Advice: attend to the temporal order of all measured
variables}\label{advice-attend-to-the-temporal-order-of-all-measured-variables}}

Addressing confounding by a common cause involves its adjustment. This
adjustment effectively closes the backdoor path from the exposure to the
outcome. Common adjustment methods include regression, matching, inverse
probability of treatment weighting, and G-methods (covered in
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023a}{M. A. Hernán and Robins 2023b}).
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-common-cause-solution} clarifies that any confounder
that is a common cause of both \(A\) and \(Y\) must precede \(A\) (and
hence \(Y\)), since effects follow their causes chronologically.

By time-indexing the nodes on the graph, we see that \textbf{control of
confounding generally necessitates time-series data.}

\hypertarget{confounding-by-collider-stratification-conditioning-on-a-common-effect}{%
\subsubsection{2. Confounding by collider stratification (conditioning
on a common
effect)}\label{confounding-by-collider-stratification-conditioning-on-a-common-effect}}

Conditioning on a common effect occurs when a variable \(L\) is affected
by the treatment \(A\) and an outcome \(Y\).

Suppose \(A\) and \(Y\) are initially independent, such that
\(A \coprod Y(a)\). Conditioning on the joint effect \(L\) opens a
backdoor path between \(A\) and \(Y\), potentially inducing a non-causal
association. This occurs because \(L\) can provide information about
both \(A\) and \(Y\). Here is an example:

Let \(A\) denote the level of belief in Big Gods (with higher values
indicating stronger belief), \(Y\) denote social complexity, and \(L\)
denote economic trade. Suppose that belief in Big Gods and social
complexity are not causally linked. However, beliefs in Big Gods and
social complexity influence levels of economic trade. Suppose we were to
condition on economic trade without attending to temporal order. In that
case, we might find a statistical association between belief in Big Gods
and social complexity without a causal association.

To clarify, denote the observed associations as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(P(A)\): Distribution of beliefs in Big Gods
\item
  \(P(Y)\): Distribution of social complexity
\item
  \(P(L)\): Distribution of economic trade
\end{itemize}

Without conditioning on \(L\), if \(A\) and \(Y\) are independent, we
have:

\[P(A, Y) = P(A)P(Y)\]

However, if we condition on \(L\) (which is a common effect of both
\(A\) and \(Y\)), we have:

\[P(A, Y | L) \neq P(A | L)P(Y | L)\]

Once conditioned on, the common effect \(L\) creates an association
between \(A\) and \(Y\) that is not causal. This association in the data
can mislead us into believing there is a direct link between beliefs in
Big Gods and social complexity, even without such a link. If we only
observed \(A\), \(Y\), and \(L\) in cross-sectional data, we might
erroneously conclude \(A \to Y\).\footnote{When \(A\) and \(Y\) are
  independent, the joint probability of \(A\) and \(Y\) is equal to the
  product of their individual probabilities: \(P(A, Y) = P(A)P(Y)\).
  However, when we condition on \(L\), the joint probability of \(A\)
  and \(Y\) given \(L\) is not necessarily equal to the product of the
  individual probabilities of \(A\) and \(Y\) given \(L\), hence the
  inequality \(P(A, Y | L) \neq P(A | L)P(Y | L)\).}

\subsubsection{Advice: attend to the temporal order of all measured
variables}\label{advice-attend-to-the-temporal-order-of-all-measured-variables-1}}

To address the problem of conditioning on a common effect, we should
generally ensure that all confounders \(L\) that are common causes of
the exposure \(A\) and the outcome \(Y\) are measured before \(A\) has
occurred, and \(A\) is measured before \(Y\) has occurred. If such
temporal order is preserved, \(L\) cannot be an effect of \(A\), and
thus neither of \(Y\).\footnote{This rule is not absolute. As indicated
  in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-descendent-solution}, it may be helpful in
  certain circumstances to condition on a confounder that occurs after
  the outcome has occurred.} In the case of the example just described,
we require time-series data with accurate measurements. We also require
a sufficiently large sample of cultures before introducing certain
religious beliefs. Moreover, the cultures would need to be independent
of each other.\footnote{The independence of cultural units was at the
  centre of the study of comparative urban archaeology from the late
  19th (\protect\hyperlink{ref-decoulanges1903}{De Coulanges 1903})
  through the late 20th century
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-wheatley1971}{Wheatley 1971}). Despite
  attention to this problem in recent work (e.g.
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-watts2016}{Watts et al. 2016})), there is
  arguably a greater head-room for understanding the need for
  conditional independence of cultures in recent cultural evolutionary
  studies. Again, attending to the temporal order of events is
  essential.}

\subsubsection{M-bias: conditioning on a collider that occurs before the
exposure may introduce
bias}\label{m-bias-conditioning-on-a-collider-that-occurs-before-the-exposure-may-introduce-bias}}

Typically, indicators for confounders should be included only if they
are known to be measured before their exposures ( exceptions described
below).

However, researchers should also be cautious about over-conditioning on
pre-exposure variables that are not associated with both the exposure
and confounder, as doing so can induce confounding. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-m-bias}, collider stratification may arise even if \(L\)
occurs before \(A\). This happens when \(L\) does not affect \(A\) or
\(Y\), but may be the descendent of an unmeasured variable that affects
\(A\) and another unmeasured variable that also affects \(Y\).
Conditioning on \(L\) in this scenario evokes ``M-bias.'' If \(L\) is
not a common cause of \(A\) and \(Y\), or the effect of a shared common
cause, \(L\) should not be included in a causal model.
Figure~\ref{fig-m-bias} presents a case in which \(A \coprod Y(a)\) but
\(A \cancel{\coprod} Y(a)| L\). M-bias is another example of collider
stratification bias (see: (\protect\hyperlink{ref-cole2010}{Stephen R.
Cole et al. 2010})).

\subsubsection{Advice: adopt the modified disjunctive cause criterion

control}\label{advice-adopt-the-modified-disjunctive-cause-criterion-for-confounding-control}}

Again, the modified disjunctive cause criterion will satisfy the
backdoor criterion in all cases and reduce bias where this criterion
cannot be fully satisfied. Again:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Control for any variable that causes the exposure, the outcome, or
  both.
\item
  Control for any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a shared
  cause of both exposure and outcome.
\item
  Define an instrumental variable as a variable associated with the
  exposure but does not influence the outcome independently, except
  through the exposure. Exclude any instrumental variable that is not a
  proxy for an unmeasured confounder from the confounder set (see: Tyler
  J. VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2020}{2020}) page 441,
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2019}{Tyler J. VanderWeele 2019}))
\end{enumerate}

Of course, the difficulty is in determining which variables belong to
the desired set! Specialist knowledge can facilitate this task but
cannot generally be ascertained from the data.

\hypertarget{mediator-bias}{%
\subsubsection{3. Mediator bias}\label{mediator-bias}}

Conditioning on a mediator -- a variable that lies along the causal
pathway between the treatment and the outcome -- can distort the total
effect of the treatment on the outcome and potentially introduce bias.
To illustrate this, consider ``beliefs in Big Gods'' as the treatment
(\(A\)), ``social complexity'' as the outcome (\(Y\)), and ``economic
trade'' as the mediator (\(L\)).

In this scenario, the belief in Big Gods (\(A\)) has a direct impact on
economic trade (\(L\)), which subsequently influences social complexity
(\(Y\)). If we condition on economic trade (\(L\)), we could bias our
estimates of the overall effect of beliefs in Big Gods (\(A\)) on social
complexity (\(Y\)). This bias happens because conditioning on \(L\) can
downplay the direct effect of \(A\) on \(Y\), as it blocks the indirect
path through \(L\). This problem, known as mediator bias, is illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-mediator}.

We might think that conditioning on a mediator does not introduce bias
under a null hypothesis (\(A\) does not cause \(Y\)), however, this is
not the case. Consider a situation where \(L\) is a common effect of the
exposure \(A\) and an unmeasured variable \(U\) linked to the outcome
\(Y\). In this scenario, including \(L\) may amplify the association
between \(A\) and \(Y\), even if \(A\) is not associated with \(Y\) and
\(U\) does not cause \(A\). This scenario is represented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-descendent}.

So, unless one is explicitly investigating mediation analysis, it is
usually not advisable to condition on a post-treatment variable. Paying
attention to chronology in the graph is crucial here: if we cannot
ensure that \(L\) is measured before \(A\) and \(A\) may affect \(L\),
including \(L\) in our model could result in mediator bias. This
scenario is presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-descendent}.

\hypertarget{advice-attend-to-the-temporal-order-of-all-measured-variables-2}{%
\subsubsection{Advice: attend to the temporal order of all measured
variables}\label{advice-attend-to-the-temporal-order-of-all-measured-variables-2}}

To mitigate the issue of mediator bias, particularly when focusing on
total effects, we should generally avoid conditioning on a mediator. We
avoid this problem by ensuring that \(L\) occurs before the treatment
\(A\) and the outcome \(Y\) (Note: a counter-example is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-descendent-solution-2}). Again, we discover the
importance of explicitly stating the temporal ordering of our
variables.\footnote{Note that if \(L\) were associated with \(Y\) and
  could not be caused by \(A\), conditioning on \(L\) would typically
  enhance the precision of the causal effect estimate of \(A \to Y\).
  This precision enhancement holds even if \(L\) occurs after \(A\).
  However, the onus is on the researcher to show that the post-treatment
  factor cannot be a consequence of the exposure.}

the exposure.}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{conditioning-on-a-descendant}{%
\subsubsection{4. Conditioning on a
descendant}\label{conditioning-on-a-descendant}}

Say \(L\) is a cause of \(L^\prime\). According to Markov factorisation,
if we condition on \(L\), we partially condition on \(L^\prime\).

Consider how conditioning might imperil causal estimation. Suppose there
is a confounder \(L^\prime\) that is caused by an unobserved variable
\(U\), and is affected by the treatment \(A\). Suppose further that
\(U\) causes the outcome \(Y\). In this scenario, as described in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-descendent}, conditioning on \(L^\prime\), which is
a descendant of \(A\) and \(U\), can lead to a spurious association
between \(A\) and \(Y\) through the path \(A \to L^\prime \to U \to Y\).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=\textheight]{causal-dags_files/figure-pdf/fig-dag-descendent-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-dag-descendent}Confounding by descent: the red
dashed arrow illustrates the introduction of bias from the opening of a
backdoor path between the exposure (A) and the outcome (Y) when
conditioning on a descendant of a confounder.}

\end{figure}

Again, the advice is clear: we should measure the (\(L^\prime\)) before
the exposure (\(A\)). This solution is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-descendent-solution}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=\textheight]{causal-dags_files/figure-pdf/fig-dag-descendent-solution-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-dag-descendent-solution}Solution: again, ensure
temporal ordering for all measured variables.}

\end{figure}

Next consider how we may use a post-treatment descendent to reduce bias.
Suppose an unmeasured confounder \(U\) affects \(A\), \(Y\), and
\(L^\prime\) as presented in, then adjusting for \(L^\prime\) may help
to reduce confounding caused by \(U\). This scenario is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-descendent-solution-2}. If we deploy the modified
disjunctive cause criterion for confounding control, we would ``include
as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common
cause of both the exposure and the outcome''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2019}{Tyler J. VanderWeele 2019}). We
discover that although \(L^\prime\) may occur \emph{after} the exposure,
and indeed occur \emph{after} the outcome, we may condition on it to
reduce confounding because it is a proxy for an unmeasured common cause
of the exposure and the confounder. This example shows that employing a
rule that requires us to condition only on pre-exposure (and indeed
pre-outcome) variables would be hasty.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=\textheight]{causal-dags_files/figure-pdf/fig-dag-descendent-solution-2-1.pdf}

\caption{\label{fig-dag-descendent-solution-2}Solution: conditioning on
a confounder that occurs after the exposure and the outcome may address
a problem of unmeasured confounding if the confounder is a descendent of
a prior common cause of the exposure and outcome. The dotted paths
denote that the effect of U on A and Y is partially adjusted by
conditioning on L', even though L' occurs after the outcome. The dotted
blue represents suppressing bias. For example, a genetic factor that
affects the exposure and the outcome early in life might be measured by
an indicator late that is expressed (and may be measured) later in life.
Adjusting for such an indicator would constitute an example of
post-outcome confounding control.}

\subsubsection{Case 1: Causal Interaction and Causal Effect
Modification: do not draw non-linear relationships such as
interactions}\label{case-1-causal-interaction-and-causal-effect-modification-do-not-draw-non-linear-relationships-such-as-interactions}}

Interactions may be of great scientific importance. How shall we depict
interactions on a graph? It is crucial to remember the primary function
of causal diagrams is to investigate confounding. Causal diagrams are
not designed to capture all facets of a phenomenon under investigation.
We should not attempt any unique visual trick to show additive and
multiplicative interaction. Including the relevant notes and paths
necessary to evaluate sources of bias is sufficient.

Misunderstandings arise about the role and function of causal diagrams
in application to interaction. Such misunderstandings typically stem
from a more profound confusion about the concept of interaction itself.
Given this deeper problem, it is worth clarifying the concept of causal
interaction as understood within the counterfactual causal framework.
Again, evaluating evidence for interaction is often essential for much
scientific research. However, we must distinguish between concepts of
causal interaction and concepts of causal effect modification because
these concepts address different causal questions.

\hypertarget{causal-interaction}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Causal
interaction}}{Causal interaction}}\label{causal-interaction}}

Causal interaction refers to the combined or separate (or non-existent)
effect of two exposures. Evidence for interaction on a given scale is
present when the effect of one exposure on an outcome hinges on another
exposure's level. For instance, the impact of beliefs in Big Gods
(exposure A) on social complexity (outcome Y) might be contingent on a
culture's monumental architecture (exposure B), which could also
influence social complexity. Evidence of causal interaction on the
difference scale would be present if:

\[\bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1,1)]}_{\text{joint exposure}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}}\bigg) - \bigg[ \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(1,0)]}_{\text{only A exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}}\bigg) + \bigg(\underbrace{E[Y(0,1)]}_{\text{only B exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}} \bigg)\bigg] \neq 0 \]

This equation simplifies to

\[ \underbrace{E[Y(1,1)]}_{\text{joint exposure}} - \underbrace{E[Y(1,0)]}_{\text{only A exposed}} - \underbrace{E[Y(0,1)]}_{\text{only B exposed}} + \underbrace{E[Y(0,0)]}_{\text{neither exposed}} \neq 0 \]

If the above equation were to hold, the effect of exposure \(A\) on the
outcome \(Y\) would differ across levels of \(B\) or vice versa. Such a
difference would provide evidence for interaction.

If the value is positive, we say there is evidence for an additive
effect. If the value is less than zero, we say there is evidence for a
sub-additive effect. If the value is virtually zero, there is no
reliable evidence for interaction.\footnote{Note that causal effects of
  interactions often differ when measured on the ratio scale. This
  discrepency can have significant policy implications, see:
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2014}{Tyler J. VanderWeele and Knol
  2014}). Although beyond the scope of this article, when evaluating
  evidence for causality we must clarify the measure of effect in which
  we are interested (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2004}{Miguel A.
  Hernán, Hernández-Díaz, and Robins 2004};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-tripepi2007}{Tripepi et al. 2007}).}

Remember that causal diagrams are non-parametric. They do not directly
represent interactions. They are tools for addressing the identification
problem. Although a causal diagram can indicate an interaction's
presence by displaying two exposures jointly influencing an outcome, as
in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-interaction}, it does not directly represent the
interaction's nature or scale.

\caption{\label{fig-dag-interaction}Causal interaction: if two exposures

E{[}Y(1,1) - Y(0,1) - Y(1,0) + Y(0,0){]} ≠ 0. If we cannot conceptualise
B as a variable upon which intervention can occur, then the interaction
is better conceived as effect modification (see next figure). Important:
do not attempt to draw a path into another path.}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{causal-effect-modification}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Causal effect
modification}}{Causal effect modification}}\label{causal-effect-modification}}

With the analysis of effect modification, we aim to understand how an
exposure's effect varies, if at all, across levels of another variable,
an effect modifier.

Suppose we are investigating how the impact of belief in Big Gods on
social complexity varies across early urban civilisations in ancient
China and South America. Here, geography (China versus South America) is
an ``effect modifier.'' Importantly, we are not treating the effect
modifier as an intervention. Rather, we wish to investigate whether
geography is a parameter that may alter the exposure's effect on an
outcome.

For clarity, consider comparing two exposure levels, represented as
\(A = a\) and \(A= a^*\). Further, assume that \(G\) represents two
levels of effect-modification, represented as \(g\) and \(g'\).

Then, the expected outcome when exposure is at level \(A=a\) among
individuals in group \(G=g\) is expressed

\[\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g]\]

The expected outcome when exposure is at level \(A=a^*\) among
individuals in group \(G=g\) is expressed

\[\hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g]\]

The causal effect of shifting the exposure level from \(a^*\) to \(a\)
in group \(g\) is expressed

\[\hat{\delta}_g = \hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g]\]

Likewise, the causal effect of changing the exposure from \(a^*\) to
\(a\) in group \(g'\) is expressed

\[\hat{\delta}_{g'} = \hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g'] - \hat{E}[Y(a^*)|G=g']\]

We compare the causal effect on the difference scale in these two groups
by computing

\[\hat{\gamma} = \hat{\delta}_g - \hat{\delta}_{g'}\]

The value of \(\hat{\gamma}\) quantifies how the effect of shifting the
exposure from \(a^*\) to \(a\) differs between groups \(g\) and \(g'\).

If \(\hat{\gamma}\neq 0\), then there is evidence for effect
modification. We may infer the exposure's effect varies by geography.

Again, remember that causal diagrams are non-parametric. Do not draw an
intersecting path or attempt other visualisations to represent effect
modification. Instead, draw two edges into the exposure. This is
depicted in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-effect-modfication}. Always remember
that the primary goal of creating a causal diagram is to evaluate
confounding.\footnote{For important distinctions within effect
  modification, see (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2007}{Tyler J.
  VanderWeele and Robins 2007}).}

\subsubsection{Case 2: Causal Mediation: causal diagrams reveal the
inadequacy of standard
approaches}\label{case-2-causal-mediation-causal-diagrams-reveal-the-inadequacy-of-standard-approaches}}

The conditions necessary for causal mediation are stringent. I present
these conditions in the chronologically ordered causal diagram shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-mediation-assumptions}. We will again consider
whether cultural beliefs in Big Gods affect social complexity. Let us
also ask whether this affect is mediated by political authority. The
assumptions required for asking causal mediation questions are as
follows

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{No unmeasured exposure-outcome confounders given} \(L\)
\end{enumerate}

This prerequisite is expressed as \(Y(a,m) \coprod A | L1\). Upon
controlling for the covariate set \(L1\), we must ensure that no
additional unmeasured confounders affect both the cultural beliefs in
Big Gods \(A\) and the social complexity \(Y\). For example, suppose our
study involves the effect of cultural beliefs in Big Gods (exposure) on
social complexity (outcome), and geographic location and historical
context define the covariates in \(L1\). In that case, we must assume
that accounting for \(L1\) ensures d-separation of \(A\) and \(Y\). The
relevant confounding path is depicted in brown in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-mediation-assumptions}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{No unmeasured mediator-outcome confounders given} \(L\)
\end{enumerate}

This condition is expressed as \(Y(a,m) \coprod M | L2\). After
controlling for the covariate set \(L2\), we must ensure that no other
unmeasured confounders affect the political authority \(M\) and social
complexity \(Y\). For instance, if trade networks impact political
authority and social complexity, we must account for trade networks to
obstruct the unblocked path linking our mediator and outcome. Further,
we must assume the absence of any other confounders for the
mediator-outcome path. This confounding path is represented in blue in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-mediation-assumptions}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{No unmeasured exposure-mediator confounders given} \(L\)
\end{enumerate}

This requirement is expressed as \(M(a) \coprod A | L3\). Upon
controlling for the covariate set \(L3\), we must ensure that no
additional unmeasured confounders affect both the cultural beliefs in
Big Gods \(A\) and political authority \(M\). For example, the
capability to construct large ritual theatres may influence the belief
in Big Gods and the level of political authority. If we have indicators
for this technology measured prior to the emergence of Big Gods (these
indicators being \(L3\)), we must assume that accounting for \(L3\)
closes the backdoor path between the exposure and the mediator. This
confounding path is shown in green in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-mediation-assumptions}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{No mediator-outcome confounder affected by the exposure (no
  red arrow)}
\end{enumerate}

This requirement is expressed as \(Y(a,m) \coprod M(a^*) | L\). We must
ensure that no variables confounding the relationship between political
authority and social complexity in \(L2\) are themselves influenced by
the cultural beliefs in Big Gods (\(A\)). For instance, when studying
the effect of cultural beliefs in Big Gods (\(A\), the exposure) on
social complexity (\(Y\), the outcome) as mediated by political
authority (mediator), there can be no factors, such as trade networks
(\(L2\)), that influence both political authority and social complexity
and are affected by the belief in Big Gods. This confounding path is
shown in red in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-mediation-assumptions}. \textbf{Note
that the assumption of no exposure-induced confounding in the
mediator-outcome relationship poses a significant challenge.} If the
exposure influences a confounder of the mediator and outcome, we face a
dilemma. Without accounting for this confounder, the backdoor path
between the mediator and the outcome remains open. By accounting for it,
however, we partially obstruct the path between the exposure and the
mediator, leading to bias. Consequently, observed data cannot identify
the natural direct and indirect effects.

Notice again that the requirements for counterfactual data science are
more strict than for descriptive or predictive data science.

Nonetheless, we can set the mediator to certain levels and explore
controlled direct and indirect effects, which may be relevant to science
and policy. For instance, if we were to fix political authority at a
specific level, we could ask, what would be Big Gods' direct and
indirect causal effects on social complexity? Other approaches involve
sampling from the observed distributions to obtain probabilistic
identification (see: (\protect\hyperlink{ref-shi2021}{Shi et al. 2021})
). Answering such questions requires G-methods
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023a}{M. A. Hernán and Robins
2023b})).

We have now considered how chronologically ordered causal diagrams
elucidate the conditions necessary for causal mediation
analysis.\footnote{An excellent resource both for understanding causal
  interaction and causal mediation is
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2015}{T. VanderWeele 2015b}).}

this path we must condition on L2. The red path denotes the effect of
the exposure on the confounder of the mediator and outcome. If any such
path exists then we cannot obtain natural direct and indirect effects.
Conditioning on L2 is necessary to prevent mediator outcome confounding
but doing so blocks the effect of the exposure on the mediator.}

In our discussion of causal mediation, we consider how the effects of
two sequential exposures may combine to affect an outcome. We can
broaden this interest to consider the causal effects of multiple
sequential exposures. In such scenarios, causal diagrams arranged
chronologically can aid in clarifying the challenges and opportunities.

For example, consider temporally fixed multiple exposures. The
counterfactual outcomes may be denoted \(Y(a_{t1} ,a_{t2})\). There are
four counterfactual outcomes corresponding to the four fixed ``treatment
regimes'':

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Always treat (Y(1,1))}
\item
  \textbf{Never treat (Y(0,0))}

There are six causal contrasts that we might compute for the four fixed
regimes, presented in Table~\ref{tbl-regimes}.\footnote{We compute the
  number of possible combinations of contrasts by
  \(C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!}\)}

Not that treatment assignments might be sensibly approached as a
function of the previous outcome. For example, we might \textbf{treat
once first} and then decide whether to treat again depending on the
outcome of the initial treatment. This aspect is known as ``time-varying
treatment regimes.''

It is important to remember that to estimate the ``effect'' of a
time-varying treatment regime, we must compare the counterfactual
quantities of interest. Just as mediation introduces the possibility of
time-varying confounding (condition 4, where the exposure affects the
confounders of the mediator/outcome path), so too do all sequential
time-varying treatments. Unlike traditional causal mediation analysis,
however, we might consider the sequence of treatment regimes
indefinitely long.

Chronologically organised causal diagrams are useful for highlighting
problems with traditional multi-level regression analysis and structural
equation modelling.

For example, we might be interested in whether belief in Big Gods
affects social complexity. Consider estimating a fixed treatment regime
first. Suppose we have a well-defined concept of Big Gods and social
complexity as well as excellent measurements for both over time. In that
case, we might want to assess the effects of beliefs in Big Gods on
social complexity, say, two centuries after the beliefs were introduced.

The fixed treatment strategies are: ``always believe in Big Gods''
versus ``never believe in Big Gods'' on the level of social complexity.
Refer to Figure~\ref{fig-dag-9}. Here, \(A_{tx}\) represents the
cultural belief in Big Gods at time \(tx\), and \(Y_{tx}\) is the
outcome, social complexity, at time \(x\). Imagine that economic trade,
denoted as \(L_{tx}\), is a time-varying confounder. Suppose its effect
changes over time, which in turns affects the factors that influence
economic trade. To complete our causal diagram, we might include an
unmeasured confounder \(U\), such as oral traditions, which could
influence both the belief in Big Gods and social complexity.

Suppose we can credibly think that the level of economic trade at time
\(0\), \(L_{t0}\), influence beliefs in ``Big Gods'' at time \(1\),
\(A_{t1}\). We therefore draw an arrow from \(L_{t0}\) to \(A_{t1}\).
But we may also think the belief in ``Big Gods'', \(A_{t1}\), affects
the future level of economic trade, \(L_{t(2)}\). Thus, we must add an
arrow from \(A_{t1}\) to \(L_{t2}\). This causal diagram represents a
feedback process between the time-varying exposure \(A\) and the
time-varying confounder \(L\). Figure~\ref{fig-dag-9} shows
exposure-confounder feedback. In a real-world setting, there would be
more arrows. However, our causal diagram needs only to show the minimum
number of arrows to exhibit the problem of exposure-confounder feedback.
As a rule, we should not clutter our causal diagrams: we should only
provide the essential details to evaluate the identification problem.

What would happen if we were to condition on the time-varying confounder
\(L_{t3}\)? Two things would occur. First, we would block all the
backdoor paths between the exposure \(A_{t2}\) and the outcome. We need
to block those paths to eliminate confounding. Therefore, conditioning
on the time-varying confounding is essential. However, paths that were
previously blocked would close. For example, the path
\(A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{t4}\), that was previously closed would be
opened because the time-varying confounder is the common effect of
\(A_{t1}\) and \(U\). Conditioning, then, opens the path
\(A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{t4}\). Therefore we must avoid conditioning on
the time-varying confounder. It would seem then that if we were to
condition on a confounder that is affected by the prior exposure, we are
``damned if we do'' and ``dammed if we do not.''

collider bias, opening a path, coloured in red, between A\_t2 and Y\_t4.
Here, we may not use conventional methods to estimate the effects of
multiple exposures. Instead, at best, we may obtain controlled effects
using G-methods. Multi-level models will not eliminate bias (!).
Currently, outside of epidemiology, G-methods are rarely used.}

A similar problem arises when a time-varying exposure and time-varying
confounder share a common cause. This problem arises even without the
exposure affecting the confounder. The problem is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-time-vary-common-cause-A1-l1}.

backdoor path when we condition on the L at time 2. Again, we cannot
infer causal effects in such scenarios by using regression-based
methods. In this setting, to address causal questions, we require
G-methods.}

\end{figure}

Complexity grows when the exposure \(A_{t1}\) influences the outcome
\(Y_{t4}\). For instance, because \(L_{t2}\) lies on the pathway from
\(A_{t1}\) to \(Y_{t4}\), conditioning on \(L_{t2}\) partially obstructs
the connection between exposure and outcome. Such conditioning triggers
both collider stratification bias and mediator bias. However, to close
the open backdoor path between \(L_{t2}\) and \(Y_{t4}\), conditioning
on \(L_{t2}\) is necessary. Yet we have just said that we must not
condition. The broader challenge of exposure-confounder feedback is
detailed in (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023a}{M. A. Hernán and
Robins 2023b}). This issue poses a significant problem for evolutionary
human sciences, and conventional regression-based methods --- including
multi-level models --- are incapable of solving it
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2006}{Miguel A. Hernán and Robins
2006}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-robins1999}{J. M. Robins, Greenland, and
Hu 1999}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-robins1986}{J. Robins 1986}). As
mentioned, models suited for evaluating the causal effects of time-fixed
and time-varying exposures are encompassed by ``G-methods''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-naimi2017}{Naimi, Cole, and Kennedy 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-chatton2020}{Chatton et al. 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2006}{Miguel A. Hernán and Robins
2006}). Even though such methods have seen considerable development
recently in the health sciences
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-williams2021}{Williams and Díaz 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-duxedaz2021}{Díaz et al. 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-breskin2020}{Breskin et al. 2020}), their
adoption in the human evolutionary sciences is still fledgling.
\footnote{It is worth noting that the identification of controlled
  effect estimates can benefit from graphical methods such as ``Single
  World Intervention Graphs'' (SWIGs), which depict counterfactual
  outcomes on the diagrams. Nevertheless, SWIGs, in their general form,
  are templates rather than causal diagrams. The application of SWIGS
  extends beyond this tutorial's scope. Refer to Richardson and Robins
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-richardson2013}{2013}) for more about SWIGs.}

\hypertarget{summary-part-2}{%
\subsubsection{Summary Part 2}\label{summary-part-2}}

To consistently estimate causal effects, we must contrast the world as
it has been with the world as it might have been. For many questions in
evolutionary human science, we have seen that confounder-treatment
feedback leads to intractable causal identification problems. We have
also seen that causal diagrams are helpful in clarifying these problems.
Many self-inflicted injuries, such as mediator bias and
post-stratification bias, could be avoided if confounders were measured
prior to the exposures. Chronologically ordered causal diagrams aim to
make this basis transparent.

I next turn to three-wave designs for estimating the total causal
effects. Such designs find inspiration from chronologically ordered
causal diagrams. They may be beneficial for evolutionary anthropologists
who wish to collect time-series data in the present and future to
address causal questions.

\subsection{Part 3. Applications of Causal Diagrams to the Understanding
of Data Collection in a Three-Wave Panel
Design}\label{part-3.-applications-of-causal-diagrams-to-the-understanding-of-data-collection-in-a-three-wave-panel-design}}

In this section, we discuss how temporally ordered causal diagrams can
help illustrate the benefits of a three-wave panel design for addressing
causal queries using data.

\hypertarget{step-1.-defining-the-exposure-measure-it-at-wave-0-and-wave-1}{%
\subsubsection{Step 1. Defining the exposure: measure it at wave 0 and
wave
1}\label{step-1.-defining-the-exposure-measure-it-at-wave-0-and-wave-1}}

We start with a well-defined exposure. Unless our focus lies in causal
interaction, causal mediation, or sequential treatment plans, our task
will be to examine the total effect of a single exposure.

Consider the causal effect of attending religious services. Our primary
task is to define the exposure as a hypothetical intervention. What
interests us? Any attendance versus non-attendance? Weekly attendance
versus monthly attendance? Or is it something else? Imagining a
hypothetical experiment, even if impractical, highlights the importance
of specifying an explicit intervention
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2022}{Miguel A. Hernán, Wang, and Leaf
2022b}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2016a}{Miguel A. Hernán et al.
2016b}).

Controlling for the exposure at the baseline also has an additional
benefit: it can lower the probability of bias from unmeasured
confounders. We shall say more about this benefit after introducing the
next step.

\hypertarget{note-without-access-to-an-exposed-populationif-the-exposure-is-rare-many-observations-must-be-collected-to-estimate-causal-effects}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Note: without access to an exposed

Assume in the non-religious population, the switch from no religious
service attendance to weekly attendance is rare, say 1 in 1,000
non-attenders per year. Acquiring an adequate sample for a ``treatment''
group while conditioning on a rich set of variables might not be
feasible without hundreds of thousands of participants. It might be more
practical to consider changes within the religious population, assuming
changes are more common within this group. However, we would then
typically estimate a causal effect that generalises to the religious
population from which the sample was drawn rather than one that
transports to the non-religious population.

\hypertarget{step-2.-define-the-outcomes-measure-them-at-wave-0-and-wave-2}{%
\subsubsection{Step 2. Define the outcome(s): measure them at wave 0 and
wave
2}\label{step-2.-define-the-outcomes-measure-them-at-wave-0-and-wave-2}}

After defining the exposure, we need to specify a well-defined outcome
or multiple outcomes. For instance, we might be interested in how
gaining or losing religious service affects the frequency of
volunteering (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly). Vague concepts such as
``the causal effects of religious change'' do not bring understanding.
We must specify what the phenomenon we wish to study, and the timing of
its occurrence (e.g.~the + 1-year effect on weekly volunteering from a
movement of 0 to weekly or more religious service attendance.)

It is crucial to control for the outcome measured at the baseline -- the
`baseline outcome' -- to verify the correct temporal order of the
cause-effect relationship, i.e., to prevent reverse causation.

Moreover, when we also control for the exposure at the baseline, then
for an unmeasured confounder to explain away the association between the
exposure at one wave from the baseline and the outcome at two waves from
the baseline, it would need to do so independently of the baseline
effect. This scenario is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-6}. This causal
diagram makes an essential practical point: although confounding might
not be entirely eliminated (the dashed arrows symbolise the potential
for uncontrolled sources of bias), data collection and analysis can
reduce bias. Given we can rarely be sure we have controlled for
unmeasured confounding, researchers should perform sensitivity analyses
(see: (\protect\hyperlink{ref-shi2021}{Shi et al. 2021})).

Note that I use the term ``wave'' without defining a specific period.
Causes must precede effects, but the amount of time needed to assess
causality will vary depending on the phenomena of interest. In a causal
diagram, \textbf{intervals need not be drawn to scale.}

reduction in bias arising from including baseline measures for the

exposure-outcome association, it would need to do so independently of
these outcome and exposure baseline measures. The graph clarifies that
by measuring confounders before the exposure and the exposure before the
outcome, we reduce the potential for reverse causation, collider
stratification, and mediator biases.}

\subsubsection{Step 3. Identify observable common causes of the exposure
and the
outcome}\label{step-3.-identify-observable-common-causes-of-the-exposure-and-the-outcome}}

Next, we should identify all the potential confounders that, when
adjusted for, can eliminate any non-causal association between the
exposure and outcome. We should group these confounders under standard
labels wherever they share the same functional dependencies in the
graph. In a three-wave panel design, confounders are recorded during the
baseline wave. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-mediator-solution},
recording confounders before the occurrence of the exposure minimises
the potential for mediation bias.

\subsubsection{Step 4. Gather data for proxy variables of unmeasured

Recall Figure~\ref{fig-dag-descendent-solution-2}: if any unmeasured
factors influence both the exposure and outcome, but we lack direct
measurements for them, we should make efforts to include proxies for
them. Again, even if this strategy cannot eliminate all bias from
unmeasured confounding, it might reduce bias.

\hypertarget{step-5.-state-the-target-population-for-whom-the-causal-question-applies}{%
\subsubsection{Step 5. State the target population for whom the causal
question
applies}\label{step-5.-state-the-target-population-for-whom-the-causal-question-applies}}

We need to define for whom our causal inference applies. For this
purpose, it is helpful to distinguish the concepts of source population
and target population and between the concepts of generalisability and
transportability.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{The source population} is the population from whom our sample
  is drawn.
\item
  \textbf{The target population} is the larger group to which we aim to
  apply our study's results. The closer the source population matches
  the target population in structural features relevant to our causal
  questions, the stronger our causal inferences about the target
  population will be.
\item
  \textbf{Generalisability}: when the causal effect estimated from a
  sample applies to the target population beyond the sample population,
  we say the causal effect estimates are generalisable. This concept is
  also known as ``external validity.''
\end{enumerate}

Let \(PATE\) denote the population average treatment effect for the
target population. Let \(ATE_{\text{source}}\) denote the average
treatment effect in the source population. Let \(W\) denote a set of
variables upon which the source and target population structurally
differ. We say that results \emph{generalise} if there is a function
such that

\[PATE =  f(ATE_{\text{source}}, W)\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Transportability}: when causal effects estimates may
  generalise to different settings and populations from which the source
  population was sampled, we say effects are transportable. Where \(T\)
  denotes a set of variables upon which the source and the target
  population structurally differ, we say that results are transportable
  if there is a function such that
\end{enumerate}

\[ATE_{\text{target}} \approx f(ATE_{\text{source}}, T)\]

This function similarly maps the average treatment effect from the
source population to a target population. The function over \(T\) might
be more complex, as it must handle potential heterogeneity of effects
and unobserved sources of bias. To assess transportability, we generally
require information about the source and target populations and a
specialist understanding. In Section 4, we will return to the concepts
of generalisability and transportability as they pertain to sample
selection.

\hypertarget{step-6.-retention-is-a-top-priority}{%
\subsubsection{Step 6. Retention is a top
priority}\label{step-6.-retention-is-a-top-priority}}

Sample retention is a mission-critical imperative for reasons we clarify
in Part 4. Panel attrition opens novel pathways for bias. Researchers
must develop protocols for tracking individuals as they change
addresses, emails, phone numbers, and names. Moreover, developing and
implementing strategies for motivating retention across the entire
population of interest (not merely those willing to volunteer for
science) is critical for causal human science. These strategies must be
developed with specialist knowledge of the population under study and
the participation and insights of the people being studied.

\hypertarget{summary-of-part-3}{%
\subsubsection{Summary of Part 3}\label{summary-of-part-3}}

The strengths of three-wave panel designs for confounding control are
demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-6}. This diagram, adapted from Tyler
J. VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2020}{2020}), highlights the
potential for residual unmeasured confounding even after incorporating
baseline measurements for both the exposure and outcome, represented by
the blue-dotted line. As such, for an unmeasured confounder \(U\) to
exert bias on the association between the exposure \(A_{t1}\) and
outcome \(Y_{t2}\), it must do so independently of the baseline
measurements of the exposure \(A_{t0}\) and outcome \(Y_{t0}\).

The diagram also reveals the advantage of three-wave panel designs for
addressing reverse causation. This control is achieved by adjusting for
both the exposure and outcome at baseline, ensuring the temporal
sequence causality required. Moreover, the diagram underscores the
capacity of three-wave panel designs to yield estimates for the
incidence, not just the prevalence, of effects.

A further understanding gained from Figure~\ref{fig-dag-6} is related to
the potential risks associated with collider stratification and mediator
bias. As discussed in Part 2, bias may arise from conditioning on a
variable measured after treatment. We can significantly reduce such
biases by ensuring the measurement of confounders takes place before the
exposure and by ensuring that the exposure is measured before the
outcome.

Figure~\ref{fig-dag-6} emphasises these factors' crucial role in guiding
the collection of repeated measures data. Nonetheless, Tyler J.
VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2020}{2020})'s causal diagram does
not account for potential bias from panel attrition. In Part 4, we will
develop this causal diagram to clarify such challenges.

\hypertarget{part-4.-applications-of-causal-diagrams-to-the-understanding-of-selection-bias}{%
\subsection{Part 4. Applications of Causal Diagrams to the Understanding
of Selection
Bias}\label{part-4.-applications-of-causal-diagrams-to-the-understanding-of-selection-bias}}

\hypertarget{introduction-to-selection-bias}{%
\subsubsection{Introduction to selection
bias}\label{introduction-to-selection-bias}}

\emph{Selection bias} may be broadly defined as the discrepancy between
the parameter of interest in a target population and the same parameter
in a subset of the population used for analysis - the source population
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2017}{M. A. Hernán 2017}). This bias
can occur if the source population differs from the target population
regarding descriptive parameters. In causal inference, our concern is
how selection bias might impact the estimation of causal effects. In
other words, how might differences between the source and target
populations influence causal contrasts on specific scales of interest
(difference, risk ratio, rate ratio, or another)? Causal diagrams help
to show what is at stake.

It is useful first to consider the following topology of confounding
developed by Suzuki and colleagues
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-suzuki2016}{Suzuki et al. 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-suzuki2014}{Suzuki and Yamamoto 2014};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-suzuki2020}{Suzuki, Shinozaki, and Yamamoto
2020}).\footnote{This typology builds on VanderWeele's work
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2012}{Tyler J. VanderWeele and
  Hernán 2012}).}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Confounding in Distribution}: if the sample exposed to each
  level of exposure is representative of the target population, we say
  there is no confounding in the distribution of the exposure's effect
  on the outcome.
\item
  \textbf{Confounding in Expectation} If the exposure assignment
  mechanism balances the confounders across each level of contrast in
  the exposure, we say there is no confounding in the expectation of the
  exposure's effect on the outcome.
\item
  \textbf{Confounding in Measure}: if a specific measure of interest
  matches the corresponding causal measure in the target population, we
  say there is no confounding in the measure of the exposure's effect on
  the outcome. As discussed previously concerning interaction, our
  inference of a causal effect can depend on the scale of the causal
  effect measure.
\item
  \textbf{Realised confounding}: if a specific exposure assignment leads
  to balance, irrespective of the exposure assignment mechanism, we say
  there is no realised confounding of the exposure's effect on the
  outcome. This concept is essential because, even in randomised
  experiments, randomisation might not eliminate chance imbalances in
  the distributions of confounders across the exposures.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these four concepts plays a role in ``confounding'' discussions,
and all are crucial when evaluating a study's scientific merit. However,
each concept highlights different issues.

Armed with these distinctions, consider
Figure~\ref{fig-selection-under-the-null}, which presents a scenario
with no (marginal) causal effect of exposure on the outcome, yet a
degree of selection into the study. We will assume randomisation
succeeded and that are no arrows into \(A\). As
Figure~\ref{fig-selection-under-the-null} shows, neither confounding in
expectation nor confounding in distribution is present. Failure to
detect an association will accurately reflect the actual state of causal
disassociation in the population. We might say that selection leads to
``confounding in distribution for confounding in expectation.'' More
simply, we might say that despite selection, the null effect in the
source population is not biased for the target population
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2004}{Miguel A. Hernán, Hernández-Díaz,
and Robins 2004}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-greenland1977}{Greenland
1977}). Note that therm ``null effect'' is a structural concept. There
are no statistical ``null effects.'' Instead there are reliable or
unreliable statistical effect estimates according to some measure of
evidence and arbitrary threshold
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bulbulia2021}{J. Bulbulia et al. 2021}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,height=\textheight]{causal-dags_files/figure-pdf/fig-selection-under-the-null-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-selection-under-the-null}Selection under the null.
An unmeasured variable affects the selection for the study and the
outcome. D-separation is preserved; there is no confounding in
expectation.}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-selection-off-the-null} presents a different scenario in
which there is selection bias for the population parameter: the
association in the population of selected individuals differs from the
causal association in the target population. Hernán calls this scenario
``selection bias off the null''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2017}{M. A. Hernán 2017}). Lu et
al.~call this scenario ``type 2 selection bias''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lu2022}{Lu et al. 2022}). This bias occurs
because the selection into the study occurs on an effect modifier for
the effect of the exposure on the outcome. Note that although the causal
effect of \(A\to Y\) is unbiased for the exposed and unexposed in the
source population, the effect estimate does not generalise to the
exposed and unexposed in the target population:
\(PATE \cancel{\approx} ATE_{\text{sample}}\).

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig-selection-off-the-null}Selection of the null: an
unmeasured variable affects selection into the study and the outcome.
Here the exposure affects the outcome. Although d-separation is
preserved, there is `confounding in distribution'.}

\end{figure}

There has been considerable technical research investigating the
conditions under which causal estimates for a target population may be
identified when the source population differs from the target population
(see: (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lu2022}{Lu et al. 2022})). There has also
been considerable technical research investigating the conditions in
which results might transport to populations that systematically differ
from the source population (see:
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bareinboim2022}{Bareinboim, Tian, and Pearl
2022}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl2022}{Pearl and Bareinboim 2022};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-deffner2022}{Deffner, Rohrer, and McElreath
2022})).To address type 2 selection bias in a three-wave pane, we must
accurately measure and adjust for a sufficient set of covariates that
affect selection \(\framebox{S}\) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lu2022}{Lu et
al. 2022}). Moreover, when drawing causal diagrams, it is vital to
present confounding as it is assumed to exist in the target population,
not the source population (see Suzuki, Shinozaki, and Yamamoto
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-suzuki2020}{2020}), especially their examples in
the supplement.)

\hypertarget{selection-bias-in-which-both-the-exposure-and-outcome-affect-censoring}{%
\subsubsection{Selection bias in which both the exposure and outcome
affect
censoring}\label{selection-bias-in-which-both-the-exposure-and-outcome-affect-censoring}}

In panel designs, there is additionally a constant threat of selection
occurring \emph{after} enrolment into the study. We next put
chronological causal diagrams to use to make sense of this threat and
derive practical advice.

We next use causal diagrams to disclose biases arising from panel
attrition. Panel attrition can be viewed as a special case of selection
bias because the participants who continue in a longitudinal study may
differ from those who drop out in ways that generate structural biases.

Figure~\ref{fig-dag-8-5} describes a scenario in which both the exposure
and the true outcome affect panel attrition, biasing the observed
association between the exposure and the measured outcome in the
remaining sample. The problem of selection here is a problem of collider
stratification bias. We can equivalently view the problem as one of
directed measurement error, described in in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-indep-d-effect}. Either way, restricting the
analysis to the retained sample introduces bias in the causal effect
estimate by opening a backdoor path from the exposure to the outcome. Lu
et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lu2022}{2022}) call this form of bias:
``type 1 selection bias'' and distinguishes between scenarios when
causal effects that generalise are recoverable (type 1a selection bias)
and not recoverable (type 1b selection bias). In both cases, we must
develop strategies to recover target population estimates from a subset
of the source population for which causal effect estimates may be biased
\textbf{for the source population.}

between the baseline and follow-up source populations. The red dashed

potential indirect association between the exposure and the outcome.
Upon considering only the selected sample (i.e., when we condition on
the selected sample \(\framebox{S}\)), we may create or obscure
associations not evident in the source population at baseline.

Figure~\ref{fig-dag-8-2} presents another problem of selection bias in a
three-wave panel design. This diagram shows how an unmeasured
confounder, U\(_S\), can simultaneously influence the outcome variable
Y\(_{t2}\) and another variable, L\(_{t2}\), responsible for attrition
(i.e., the drop-out rate, denoted as \(\framebox{S}\)). Here we present
a scenario in which the exposure variable \(A_{t1}\) can impact a
post-treatment confounder L\(_{t2}\), which subsequently affects
attrition, \(\framebox{S}\). If the study's selected sample descends
from L\(_2\), the selection effectively conditions on L\(_{t2}\),
potentially introducing bias into the analysis. Figure~\ref{fig-dag-8-2}
marks this biasing pathway with red-dashed lines. Ordering the nodes
chronologically in one's graph elucidates the assumed temporal sequence
of events, allowing for a more precise assessment of potential bias
sources relevant to a three-wave panel design.

\subsubsection{Why regression adjustment fails to address select bias
from
attrition}\label{why-regression-adjustment-fails-to-address-select-bias-from-attrition}}

We cannot address selection bias from attrition using regression.
Shifting the example from culture to health, suppose that sicker
individuals or those with less successful outcomes are likelier to drop
out of the study. If this occurs, the remaining sample will not
represent the original population; it will over-represent healthier
individuals or those with more successful outcomes.

We use regression adjustment to control for confounding variables across
the treatment groups. With loss-to-follow-up, regression adjustment can
only address selection bias. The remaining censored population may
differ from the source population in the average association between the
exposure and the outcome.

What to do?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Prevention}: obviously, the best way to deal with missing data
  is to prevent it in the first place. Maintain regular contact with
  study participants, using incentives for continued participation,
  making follow-ups as convenient as possible, and tracking participant
  details from multiple sources (email, phone, secondary contacts).
\item
  \textbf{Missing data imputation}: this requires predicting the missing
  values based on our data, assuming that the missingness is random
  conditional on baseline measures. Note that this missingness should be
  predicted separately within strata of the exposed and unexposed in the
  previous wave (see: (\protect\hyperlink{ref-westreich2015}{Westreich
  et al. 2015}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-zhang2023}{Zhang et al. 2023})).
  Imputation methods typically assume that data are missing conditional
  on a correctly specified model and information obtained at baseline.
\item
  \textbf{Inverse probability weighting with censoring weights}: this
  requires weighting the values of each participant in the study by the
  inverse of the probability of their observed pattern of missingness
  (censoring weights)(\protect\hyperlink{ref-leyrat2019}{Leyrat et al.
  2019}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-cole2008}{Stephen R. Cole and Hernán
  2008}). In this approach, the sample gives more weight to
  under-represented individuals owing to drop-out. As with missing data
  imputation, IPW with censoring weights also assumes that we can
  correctly model the missingness from the observed data.
\item
  \textbf{Sensitivity analysis}: as with nearly all causal inference, we
  should quantitatively evaluate how sensitive results are to different
  assumptions and methods for handling censoring events

\subsubsection{Summary of Part 4}\label{summary-of-part-4}}

In this segment, I used causal diagrams to elucidate potential
confounding from selection bias. Here is my take-home advice:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Broad sampling}: to ensure that the results of your study can
  be generalised, strive to sample extensively from the target
  population. A broad sample will offer more opportunities to measure
  all effect modifiers. With these data.
\item
  \textbf{Accurate measurement and adjustment for covariates}: in
  developing a three-wave panel, addressing Type 2 selection bias
  requires precise measurements and appropriate confounding control
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lu2022}{Lu et al. 2022}). Failing to measure
  and adjust for these covariates may lead to erroneous conclusions
  about the relationship between exposure and outcome.
\item
  \textbf{Construct causal diagrams for the target population}: causal
  diagrams should represent confounding as it exists in the target
  population (see Suzuki, Shinozaki, and Yamamoto
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-suzuki2020}{2020}), especially the
  supplementary materials provided).
\item
  \textbf{Maximise retention}: retention, retention, retention. Rention
  is the mission-critical objective.
\item
  \textbf{Use multiple imputation or inverse probability of treatment
  with censoring weights to adjust for attrition} Achieving a 100\%
  retention rate is typically unattainable. To reduce disparities
  between the source population at baseline and the population from
  which the censored participants were drawn.
\item
  \textbf{Perform sensitivity analyses} to assess the robustness of
  results to methods for handling attrition.

\subsection{Part 5. Applications of Causal Diagrams to the Understanding
of Measurement
Bias}\label{part-5.-applications-of-causal-diagrams-to-the-understanding-of-measurement-bias}}

Here, we use causal diagrams to clarify bias through vectors of
measurement error and discuss implications for research design.
Following Miguel A. Hernán and Cole
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2009}{2009}), we first define
structural concepts of measurement error and draw causal diagrams to
understand how they may bias causal effect estimates (see also
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2012}{Tyler J. VanderWeele and Hernán
2012})).

\hypertarget{uncorrelated-non-differential-undirected-measurement-error}{%
\subsubsection{1. Uncorrelated non-differential (undirected) measurement
error}\label{uncorrelated-non-differential-undirected-measurement-error}}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-uu-null}, an uncorrelated
non-differential measurement error occurs when the errors in the
measurement of the exposure and outcome are not related.

To clarify, consider again the task of estimating the causal effect of
beliefs in Big Gods on social complexity. Suppose ancient societies
randomly omitted or recorded details about both beliefs in Big Gods and
indicators of social complexity in their records. Alternatively, suppose
that such records were not preserved equally across cultures for reasons
unrelated to these parameters. In this case, errors in the documentation
of both variables would be random. The errors would not be related to
the intensity of the beliefs in Big Gods or the level of social
complexity. This example of uncorrelated and non-differential error is
presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-uu-null}.

Uncorrelated non-differential measurement error does not create bias
under the null. As evident from Figure~\ref{fig-dag-uu-null},
d-separation is preserved. Equivalently, there are no open backdoor
paths on the graph. However, when there is an actual effect of the
exposure on the outcome, non-differential measurement error generally
leads to attenuated effect estimates. For this reason, uncorrelated
non-differential measurement error can be problematic for inference even
though it does not induce structural bias under the null.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{uncorrelated-differential-directed-measurement-error}{%
\subsubsection{2. Uncorrelated differential (directed) measurement
error}\label{uncorrelated-differential-directed-measurement-error}}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-indep-d-effect}, uncorrelated
differential (or directed) measurement error occurs when the measurement
errors are related to the level of exposure or outcome but not to each
other. For instance, societies with stronger `beliefs in Big Gods' might
have more or less detailed records of `social complexity'. Suppose that,
in the absence of any intervention on beliefs in Gods, there is no
association between the measurement errors. Here, the errors are
differential as they depend on the intensity of religious beliefs but
are uncorrelated as the errors in documenting `beliefs in Big Gods' and
`social complexity' are otherwise independent. Uncorrelated differential
(or directed) measurement error is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-indep-d-effect} and leads to bias under the null,
indicated by the red path. Alternatively, equivalently, uncorrelated
differential (or directed) measurement error opens a backdoor path
between the exposure and the outcome.

Note that the bias presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-indep-d-effect}, an
example of directed measurement error, also describes the bias we
considered when there is panel attrition and which the exposure affects
selection (see: Figure~\ref{fig-dag-8-5}). In that scenario, the outcome
in the selected group is measured with error -- it no longer represents
the measurement of the outcome in the source population at baseline --
furthermore, this error is affected by exposure. The previous example
described bias in estimation from the vantage point of collider
stratification; however, we can also explain the distortion as directed
measurement bias.

\hypertarget{correlated-non-differential-undirected-measurement-error}{%
\subsubsection{3. Correlated non-differential (undirected) measurement
error}\label{correlated-non-differential-undirected-measurement-error}}

As shown, Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect} correlated non-differential
(undirected) measurement error occurs when the errors in measuring both
the exposure and outcome are related independently of the exposure. The
scenario is presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect}. Imagine that
some societies had more advanced record-keeping systems that resulted in
more accurate and detailed accounts of both beliefs in Big Gods and
social complexity. Furthermore, imagine that record keepers provide
better information about religious beliefs. In this case, the errors
between beliefs in Big Gods and social complexity are correlated because
the accuracy of records for both variables is influenced by the same
underlying factor (the record-keeping abilities). However, the errors
are not directed insofar as levels of religious beliefs and social
complexity do not affect the assumed bias in record keeping. Correlated
non-differential measurement error may induce bias under the null,
indicated by the red path in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect}.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{correlated-differential-directed-measurement-error}{%
\subsubsection{4. Correlated differential (directed) measurement
error}\label{correlated-differential-directed-measurement-error}}

Correlated differential (directed) measurement error occurs when the
measurement errors are related independently of the exposure, and the
exposure also affects levels of these correlated error terms. The
structure of this bias is presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-d-d}. Suppose
societies with stronger beliefs in Big Gods tend to record their
religious beliefs and social structures more meticulously than others.
Suppose further that religious elites conduct this record-keeping. The
errors may be both correlated and differential if societies with beliefs
in Big Gods tend to favour these religious elites, leading to biased
records.

Consider further the three-wave panel design, where we aim to estimate
the effect of self-reported religious service attendance on
self-reported monthly donations to charity. A set of confounders is
included at baseline, comprising previous measures of religious service
attendance and monthly donations to charity. Because our measures rely
on self-reports, they may be especially prone to measurement error.

Assume there is an unmeasured common cause affecting both the
measurement error of religious service attendance and the measurement
error of donations to charity. This bias might occur if individuals
consistently over- or under-report their religious service attendance
and donations due to social desirability bias.

In Part 3, we discussed how including the exposure measured at baseline
can reduce confounding in a three-wave panel design. By controlling for
the baseline exposure, we effectively adjust for any static
characteristics that cause a correlation between the exposure and
outcome.

Now for measurement error, including baseline measures could mitigate
the impact of these errors on causal effect estimation, provided the
errors are random and not systematically associated across time points.

To see this, let \(A_0\), \(A_1\) denote the exposure at baseline and
follow-up, and \(Y_0\), \(Y_1\) denote the outcome at baseline and
follow-up. The true values are denoted without primes, and the measured
values are with primes. We assume the measurement error is additive:

\(A'_0 = A_0 + UA_0\),

\(A'_1 = A_1 + UA_1\),

\(Y'_0 = Y_0 + UY_0\),

\(Y'_2 = Y_2 + UY_2\),

where \(UA_0\), \(UA_1\) are the measurement errors for the exposure at
baseline and follow-up, and \(UY_0\), \(UY_2\) are the measurement
errors for the outcome at baseline and follow-up. If the errors are
correlated, then \(Cov(UA_0, UY_0) \neq 0\) and/or
\(Cov(UA_1, UY_2) \neq 0\).

In a model that includes \(A'_0\) and \(Y'_0\) as covariates, the
estimated effect of \(A'_1\) on \(Y'_2\) identifies the effect of change
in the exposure from baseline to follow-up on the incidence effect.
Because our interest is in this incidence effect, we control for the
baseline exposure and outcome measures. This strategy will mitigate bias
arising from correlated errors if the following conditions hold:

\(E(UA_0) = E(UA_1)\) and \(E(UY_0) = E(UY_2)\) (i.e., the expectation
of the measurement errors does not change over time),

\(Cov(UA_0, UY_2) = Cov(UA_1, UY_2)\) (i.e., the correlation between the
errors does not change over time).

Thus, including baseline measurements in our model can mitigate
undirected measurement errors. However, this solution hinges on the
measurement error being undirected and non-differential concerning time.
If the measurement error varies over time or affects other variables in
the model, baseline measurement control will be inadequate for
confounding control (see: (\protect\hyperlink{ref-keogh2020}{Keogh et
al. 2020})).

Consider a scenario where individuals who attend religious service more
at wave 1 acquire more substantial social desirability bias, becoming
more likely to over-report socially desirable behaviours or under-report
socially undesirable ones. The structure of this scenario is presented
in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-d-d}. If the measured outcome at wave 2 is
charitable giving, the increased social desirability bias could lead to
an overestimation of the actual level of giving. Suppose we compare
reported charity at wave 2 with reported religious attendance at wave 1.
If there is directed measurement bias we might falsely attribute the
apparent increase in charity to the increase in religious service
attendance, when, in reality, there was over-reporting from social
desirability bias that was induced by religious service attendance. Here
we can see that if the error of the outcome is affected by the exposure,
the causal effect of the increase in religious service on charitable
giving might be different from the association presented in the data.

Thus, although controlling for baseline exposure is a powerful strategy
for isolating incidence effects and controlling confounding, we have
seen that it is not a catch-all solution. Attention to the quality of
measures at all time points remains critical.

For instance, to avoid presentation bias, rather than asking whether one
has \emph{offered} help, we might ask participants in a multi-wave study
whether they have \emph{received help} -- under the assumption that if
the religious community is more altruistic than the secular community,
the probability of receiving help will be higher.

\subsubsection{Correlated undirected measurement error in comparative
cultural
research}\label{correlated-undirected-measurement-error-in-comparative-cultural-research}}

In comparative cultural research, a common practice is to use invariance
testing, a set of statistical models, to evaluate the appropriateness of
the measures employed. However, statistical models do not determine
structural models: statistical tests performed on cross-sectional
datasets may not effectively identify causal features.

How might we understand those causal features?
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect-selection} shows how selecting study
participants from different cultures that systematically differ in their
responses to the exposure and outcome may induce correlated measurement
errors. To show this possibility, we adjust the causal diagram presented
as Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect} and incorporate the selection into
the study. The resulting graph is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect-selection}.

If we were to select participants from a setting devoid of systematic
(correlated) error structures between the exposure and outcome
measurements, we might avoid such confounding. However, the very process
of sample selection in a cross-cultural study may open pathways for
measurement bias if people from different cultures interpret and respond
to the measures differently. We cannot stratify on culture to address
the problem because stratifying on culture is what evokes correlated
measurement error.

\subsubsection{Using causal diagrams to clarify the structural
assumptions of latent factor
models}\label{using-causal-diagrams-to-clarify-the-structural-assumptions-of-latent-factor-models}}

Human evolutionary scientists who wish to record cultural evolutionary
dynamics in the present may consider using multi-item constructs in
their panel studies. Multi-item constructs have long been favoured by
traditional psychometric theory. However, classical psychometric theory
developed without the benefit of causal approaches. VanderWeele argues
that difficulties surface when assessing the causal assumptions of
formative and reflective latent factor models
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2022}{Tyler J. VanderWeele 2022}).
These models are based on statistical formulations. However, the causal
inferences they embody cannot be determined solely by statistical
models. This discussion will concentrate on reflective models, although
the concerns raised are equally applicable to formative models, and I
refer interested readers to:
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2022}{Tyler J. VanderWeele
2022}).\footnote{In formative models, observed variables are perceived
  to generate the latent variable. This latent variable is assumed to be
  a composite of the observed variables, \(X_i\), mathematically
  expressed as \(\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i\). The structural assumption
  is that a single latent variable causally influences the observed
  variables. This structural is depicted in
  Figure~\ref{fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model}.}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=\textheight]{causal-dags_files/figure-pdf/fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model}Structural
assumptions of the reflective model imply a univariate reality causes
the outcome. These assumptions are strong because they exclude
multivariate causes of the indicators for constructs, as well as
independent effects of the indicators on outcomes. The figure is adapted
from VanderWeele: doi: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001434}

\end{figure}

However, VanderWeele notes that the statistical model is consistent with
multiple causal models. The presumption that a univariate latent reality
underlies the reflective (and formative) latent factor models is a
stronger assumption than previously acknowledged. For example, an
alternative structural model equally compatible with the data is
presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag_multivariate_reality_again}. Here,
multivariate reality gives rise to the indicators from which we draw our
measures. Indeed, for specific widely used measures, the assumption of a
univariate reality is so strong that they make testable assumptions, and
empirical examination of these assumptions reveals the tests fail
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2022b}{Tyler J. VanderWeele and
Vansteelandt 2022}). Although we cannot determine which structural model
is accurate, the data rule out the univariate model.

measures. The figure is adapted from VanderWeele: doi:

\end{figure}

Although the assumptions of a univariate reality that underlie
traditional latent factor models are not generally credible, VanderWeele
suggests that construct measures can still find application in research.
The key to salvaging latent factor models is to extend the theory of
causal inference under multiple interventions to latent factor models
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2022}{Tyler J. VanderWeele 2022}).
Specifically, by framing measured variables as functions of indicators
that may map onto a complex multivariate underlying reality, we may
approach them as coarsened indicators for that reality. As long as the
potential outcomes of these coarsened indicators are conditionally
independent of their treatment assignments and there is no unmeasured
confounding, we may assume the constructs to consistently estimate the
causal effects of the complex reality that gives rise to them. This
interpretation is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-multiple-version-treatment-applied-measurement}.
Just as with the theory of causal inference under multiple versions of
treatments, there may be circumstances where ensuring conditional
exchangeability is unattainable; even when such assurance is feasible,
interpreting the results or advocating policy intervention may be
problematic. Thus, I maintain a more restrained optimism about this
generalisation of the theory of causal inference under multiple versions
of treatment. In the subsequent section, I show how a causal diagram
helps to clarify the unresolved measurement biases.

\subsubsection{Causal diagrams highlight issues arising from measurement
errors within construct
components}\label{causal-diagrams-highlight-issues-arising-from-measurement-errors-within-construct-components}}

Consider a three-wave panel with the assumption that no unmeasured
confounding exists. We represent the exposure \(A\) as a function of
indicators, \(A_{f(A_1, A_2, ..., A_n)}\), representing a coarsened
state of a multivariate reality. Each component of this reality
corresponds to a structural element, represented as
\(\eta_{A_1}, \eta_{A_2}, ..., \eta_{A_n}\), each with associated error
terms, \(U\eta_{A_1}, U\eta_{A_2}, ..., U\eta_{A_n}\).

We can similarly conceptualise the outcome \(Y\), as a function of
indicators, \(Y_{f(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n)}\), representing a latent
reality. This latent reality is composed of the components
\(\eta_{Y_1}, \eta_{Y_2}, ..., \eta_{Y_n}\), each with their
corresponding error terms
\(U\eta_{Y_1}, U\eta_{Y_2}, ..., U\eta_{Y_n}\).

Figure~\ref{fig-dag-coarsen-measurement-error} depicts this assumed
reality and outlines potential confounding paths due to directed
measurement error. Each path consists of a structural component
\(\eta_{A_n}\) and its associated error term \(U\eta_{Y_n}\). We
identify three potential confounding paths resulting from directed
measurement error.

The potential for confounding from measurement error in panel designs
fundamentally relies on the relationships and dependencies among
variables, not their quantity. However, it is worth emphasising that, in
theory, an increase in the number of latent states or error terms could
enhance the potential for confounding. Under simplifying assumptions,
the potential direct paths from the exposure to the outcome are given by
the product of the number of components of the exposure and the number
of error terms associated with the outcome, symbolically represented as
\(\eta A_n \times U\eta_{Y_n}\). In this simplified scenario, each
latent variable connected to exposure could influence every error term
of an outcome, creating a complex network of confounding paths.

Causal diagrams applied to measurement error in latent factor models
reveal the importance of rigorously considering construct measures in
evolutionary and other human sciences. Although there is no universal
rule here, researchers might sometimes opt to use single-item measures.
Each case, however, demands a meticulous examination of the items'
meanings, probable interpretations, and potential causal implications
over time.

\hypertarget{summary-part-5}{%
\subsubsection{Summary Part 5}\label{summary-part-5}}

Part 5 describes sources of bias from measurement error in repeated
measures data designs Such designs are powerful tools for quantitatively
estimating causal effects. Measurement bias highlights their weaknesses.
We have examined four kinds of measurement error bias, assessing how
each might skew inference. Although adjustments for the baseline
exposure can aid in reducing confounding (and isolate incidence
effects), it is not a panacea. Often the exposure, or the source of
error in its measurement, may plausibly affect the measurement of the
outcome. In such cases, the correlations we obtain may be biased
indicators of causation.

Although methods for adjusting for measurement error are not covered in
this article, a host of useful resources exists, including the works of
Keogh et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-keogh2020}{2020}) Buonaccorsi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-buonaccorsi2010}{2010}) Shi et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-shi2021}{2021}) Valeri, Lin, and VanderWeele
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-valeri2014}{2014}) and Bandalos
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bandalos2018}{2018}). For now, it is important
that researchers think carefully about the measures they employ, and how
the errors in these measures may compromise their causal inferences.

\hypertarget{review}{%
\subsubsection{Review}\label{review}}

Should Cicero have been present in our era, he might exclaim:
``\emph{Causalis Ante Statisticum!}'' --- prioritise the causal over the
statistical!

In the human sciences, statistical models hold sway. This interest is
understandable. Statistics is indispensable for quantitative insights.
To repeat: statistics is indispensable for quantitative insights. This
includes quantitative insights into causation. However, if we aim to
quantitatively understand the causal effects of interventions, a
structural approach take precedence. Statistics is necessary, but it
come later.

Causal inference hinges on having well-defined and accurately measured
exposure and outcome variables. Additionally, any factors that may link
the exposure and outcome without a causal connection need to be
identified by experts and measured during data collection. It is crucial
to establish a timeline delineating the sequential occurrence of the
confounder, exposure, and outcome. By chronologically capturing
measurements of the exposure, outcome, and confounders at baseline, and
then re-measuring the exposure and outcome, given reliable measurements
and adequate sample size, we can model our observational data to
simulate a ``target trial.''

When comparing outcomes across exposed and unexposed units, typically
individuals, a rigorous follow-up and retention effort is needed.
Tracking individuals is difficult. Given the inevitability of retention
failures in any sizeable sample, the need to counteract biases from loss
to follow-up forms will be inevitable. However the better the retention
and measures, the less dependent our analysis will be on assumptions.
Rigourous data collection is the journey, but it is also the
destination.

Nearly all of the work we must do in causal inference extends beyond
merely fitting models to data -- although it is undoubtedly that too.
Moreover, the statistical models that robust counterfactual data science
demands, which I have not covered in this article, will be unfamiliar to
many human scientists. It takes an effort to retool.

Causal inference, then, is a labour of love. This labour is not for the
faint-hearted. Nonetheless, it is worth the effort because it offers
hope for a quantitative understanding of causation. Such an
understanding animates the curiosity and drive of most human scientists,
even if we have too often contented ourselves with correlations. In this
discussion, I have described several ways that chronologically ordered
causal diagrams contribute to counterfactual data science. Their utility
is not limited to modelling; they are excellent guides for data
collection. With judicious use, causal diagrams can aid our quest for
the robust causal understanding we seek.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \textbf{Clearly define all variables}: clearly define the exposure and
  outcome through protocols of a hypothetical experiment or ``target
  trial.''
\item
  \textbf{Clearly define novel conventions in your causal diagram}: if
  you use unique conventions -- such as coloured or dash edges -- ensure
  the meanings of the conventions are stated
\item
  \textbf{Ensure the graph is acyclic:} a node cannot be its own
  ancestor, which ensures no circular paths exist within the graph.
\item
  \textbf{Time-stamp nodes}: time-stamping nodes often provide clearer
  temporal understanding. Because causation occurs over time, causal
  diagrams benefit when this understanding is visually evident.
\item
  \textbf{Maintain chronological order}: arrange nodes in temporal
  sequence, generally from left to right or top to bottom.
\item
  \textbf{Embrace minimalism}: include only those essential nodes and
  edges for clarifying the identification problem. Refrain from
  cluttering the causal diagram. The sequence of events should be
  evident in the spatial layout. However, it is rarely necessary to draw
  that sequence to scale.
\item
  \textbf{Show vectors for unmeasured confounding} : plan for
  sensitivity analyses to assess whether unmeasured confounding might
  explain away results.
\item
  \textbf{Show nodes for post-treatment selection}: this helps to
  understand potential sources of selection bias.
\item
  \textbf{Should mediation or interaction be of interest, extend the
  graphs to clarify the relevant structures of bias}: but do not attempt
  to draw non-linear associations between the variables on your graph.
\item
  \textbf{Appreciate causal diagrams are qualitative tools that encode
  assumptions about causal ancestries}: causal diagrams are akin to
  compasses that guide us to close backdoor paths. We should refrain
  from using them as exhaustive atlases for reality.
\item
  \textbf{Show vectors of correlated and/or directed measurement error}:
  where such vectors may be assumed to create compromising bias.
\item
  \textbf{Distinction between causal diagrams, structural models, and
  structural equation models}: Causal diagrams are indeed structural
  (causal) models. Conversely, despite the terminology, structural
  equation models primarily engage in statistical analysis rather than
  providing causal insights. The coefficients derived from structural
  equation models can often be difficult to interpret causally. Such
  models would be more appropriately called ``correlational equation
  models.'' Regression coefficients, including those from correlational
  equation models, rarely convey causal implications. If our primary
  interest lies in causal inference, we should refrain from emphasising
  these coefficients, which frequently lack meaningful interpretation.
  Our prior discussions on mediation and treatment-confounder feedback
  revealed foils for causal inference in seemingly simple scenarios.
  G-methods offer powerful solutions for causal estimation in such
  scenarios. Despite their efficacy, many in the evolutionary human
  sciences have yet to adopt G-methods them. However, for situations
  with multiple exposure events, where exposure can influence subsequent
  exposure confounders or where hidden confounders can connect them,
  G-methods are currently the tool of choice
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hernuxe1n2023}{M. A. Hernán and Robins

\hypertarget{concluding-remarks}{%
\subsubsection{Concluding remarks}\label{concluding-remarks}}

Causal inference is essential for science because it offers a way to
quantify the effects of interventions. However, it is only a small part
of science. Particularly in the historical sciences, the fundamental
assumptions of causal inference may not be applicable. We should not
abandon sciences that do not quantify causal effect estimates.

That said, many human scientists have yet to adopt causal inferential
approaches. In most fields, the correlational methods that have held
sway and still hold sway. We are a long way from overstating the
importance of causal inference.

Chronologically ordered causal diagrams highlight the necessity of
time-series data for answering quantitative causal questions. This high
demand for time-series data collection for causal inference brings
substantial implications for research design, funding models, and the
pace of scientific discovery. A three-year panel design, accounting for
research preparation, data collection, and data entry, would necessitate
at least five years of support. However, prevailing funding models often
only provide for 2-3 years. Those committed to uncovering causal
understanding must demonstrate patience. This raises an important
question: will the rigour required for causal inference garner enough
support? Current funding models across the human sciences generally do
not reflect this level of patience and investment. (Notable exceptions,
however, do exist.)

Most human scientists want to understand the effects of interventions on
the world. Progress depends on our ability to transition from a
productivity model of human science reminiscent of an assembly line or
counterfeit money press to a system that nurtures long-term data
collection.

\subsection{Appendix 1: Review of VanderWeele's theory of causal
inference under multiple versions of
treatment}\label{appendix-1-review-of-vanderweeles-theory-of-causal-inference-under-multiple-versions-of-treatment}}

We denote an average causal effect as the change in the expected
potential outcomes when all units receive one level of treatment
compared to another.

Let \(\delta\) denote the causal estimand on the difference scale
\((\mathbb{E}[Y^1 - Y^0])\). The causal effect identification can be
expressed as:

\[ \delta = \sum_l \left( \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a,l] - \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a^*,l] \right) P(l)\]

The theory of causal inference with multiple treatment versions provides
a conceptual framework for causal inference in observational studies.
Suppose we can assume that for each treatment version, the outcome under
that version equals the observed outcome when that version is
administered, conditional on baseline covariates and satisfaction of
other assumptions. In that case, we can consistently estimate causal
contrasts, even when treatments vary.

This approach interprets treatment indicator \(A\) as multiple actual
treatment versions \(K\). Furthermore, if we can assume conditional
independence, meaning there is no confounding for the effect of \(K\) on
\(Y\) given \(L\), we have: \(Y(k)\coprod A|K,L\).

This condition implies that, given \(L\), \(A\) adds no additional
information about \(Y\) after accounting for \(K\) and \(L\). If
\(Y = Y(k)\) for \(K = k\) and \(Y(k)\) is independent of \(K\),
conditional on \(L\), we can interpret \(A\) as a simplified indicator
of \(K\) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2013}{Tyler J. VanderWeele
and Hernan 2013}). This scenario is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag_multiple_version_treatment_dag}.

With the necessary assumptions in place, we can derive consistent causal
effects. The causal effect can be expressed

\[ \delta = \sum_{k,l} \left( \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a,l) P(l) - \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a^*,l) P(l) \right) \]

This setup is akin to a randomised trial where individuals, stratified
by covariate \(L\), are assigned a treatment version \(K\). This
assignment comes from the distribution of \(K\) for the
\((A = 1, L = l)\) subset. The control group receives a randomly
assigned \(K\) version from the \((A = 0, L = l)\) distribution.

\caption{\label{fig-dag_multiple_version_treatment_dag}Causal inference
under multiple versions of treatment. Here, (A) may be regarded as a
coarseneed indicator of (K)}

\end{figure}

This theory of causal inference under multiple versions of treatment is
advantageous when treatments exhibit significant variability
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2013}{Tyler J. VanderWeele and Hernan
2013}). In Part 5, I explored VanderWeele's application of this theory
(which he developed) to latent factor models, where the presumption of a
single underlying reality for the items that constitute constructs can
be challenged (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2022}{Tyler J.
VanderWeele 2022}). Furthermore, I described additional complications
not addressed by this theory extension arising from measurement error.
Specifically, the possibility that directed or correlated error terms
for the exposure and outcome could undermine inference.
