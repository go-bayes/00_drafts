### Measurement



Cultural evolutionary researchers who collect data may be enticed to use psychometrically validated scales. A scale consists of items -- such as survey questions, that are used to measure a "construct" which is a concept useful for psychological theory, such as "psychological distress."  In psychometric research, formative and reflective models are used describe the relationship between latent variables and their respective indicators.

In a reflective measurement model, also known as an effect indicator model, the latent variable is understood to cause the observed variables. In this model, changes in the latent variable cause changes in the observed variables. Each indicator (observed variable) is a 'reflection' of the latent variable. In other words, they are effects or manifestations of the latent variable. The assumed relations are presented in @fig-dag-latent-1.

The reflective model may be expressed:

$$X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$$

Here, $X_i$ is an observed variable (indicator), $\lambda_i$ is the factor loading for $X_i$, $\eta$ is the latent variable, and $\varepsilon_i$ is the error term associated with $X_i$. It is assumed that all the indicators are interchangeable and have a common cause, which is the latent variable $\eta$.

In the conventional approach of factor analysis, the assumption is that a common latent variable is responsible for the correlation seen among the indicators. Thus, any fluctuation in the latent variable should immediately lead to similar changes in the indicators.These assumptions are presented in @fig-dag-latent-1.

In psychometric research, formative and reflective models describe the relationship between latent variables and their respective indicators.

### Reflective Model (Factor Analysis)

In a reflective measurement model, also known as an effect indicator model, the latent variable is understood to cause the observed variables. In this model, changes in the latent variable cause changes in the observed variables. Each indicator (observed variable) is a 'reflection' of the latent variable. In other words, they are effects or manifestations of the latent variable. These relations are presented in @fig-dag-latent-1.

The reflective model may be expressed:

$$X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$$

Here, $X_i$ is an observed variable (indicator), $\lambda_i$ is the factor loading for $X_i$, $\eta$ is the latent variable, and $\varepsilon_i$ is the error term associated with $X_i$. It is assumed that all the indicators are interchangeable and have a common cause, which is the latent variable $\eta$.

In the conventional approach of factor analysis, the assumption is that a common latent variable is responsible for the correlation seen among the indicators. Thus, any fluctuation in the latent variable should immediately lead to similar changes in the indicators.These assumptions are presented in @fig-dag-latent-1.

\end{tikzpicture}
```

### The Formative Model (Factor Analysis)

In a formative measurement model, the observed variables are seen as causing or determining the latent variable. Here again, there is a single latent variable. However this latent variable is taken to be an effect of the underlying indicators. These relations are presented in @fig-dag-latent-formative_0.

The formative model may be expressed:

$$\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon$$

In this equation, $\eta$ is the latent variable, $\lambda_i$ is the weight for $X_i$ (the observed variable), and $\varepsilon$ is the error term. The latent variable $\eta$ is a composite of the observed variables $X_i$.

In the context of a formative model, correlation or interchangeability between indicators is not required. Each indicator contributes distinctively to the latent variable. As such, a modification in one indicator doesn't automatically imply a corresponding change in the other indicators.

## Structural Interpretation of the formative model and reflective models (Factor Analysis)

VanderWeele has recently raised a host of problems arising for formative and reflective models that become clear when we examine their causal assuptions [@vanderweele2022].

> However, this analysis of reflective and formative models assumed that the latent η was causally efficacious. This may not be the case (VanderWeele 2022)

VanderWeele distinguishes between statistical and structural interpretations of the equations preesented above.

1.  **Statistical Model:** a mathematical construct that shows how observable variables, also known as indicators, are related to latent or unseen variables. These are presented in the equations above

2.  **Structural Model:** A structural model refers to the causal assumptions or hypotheses about the relationships among variables in a statistical model. The assumptions of the factor analytic tradition are presented in @fig-dag-latent-formative_0 and @fig-dag-latent-1 are structural models.

We have seen that the **reflective model** statistically implies that the observed variables (indicators) are reflections or manifestations of the latent variable, expressed as $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$. However, the factor analytic tradition makes the additional structural assumption that a univariate latent variable is causally efficacious and influences the observed variables, as in: @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model.

We have also seen that the **formative model** statistically implies that the latent variable is formed or influenced by the observed variables, expressed as $\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon$. However, the factor analytic tradition makes the additional assumption that the observed variables give rise to a univariate latent variable, as in @fig-dag-reflective-assumptions_note.

The reflective model implies $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$, which factor analysts take to imply @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model.

The formative model implies $\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon$, which factor analysts take to imply @fig-dag-reflective-assumptions_note.

## Problems with the structural interpretations of the reflective and formative factor models.

While the statistical model $X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i$ aligns with @fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model, it also alings with @fig-dag-formative-assumptions-compatible. Cross-sectional data, unfortunately, do not provide enough information to discern between these different structural interpretations.

Similarly, the statistical model $\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon$ agrees with @fig-dag-reflective-assumptions_note but it also agrees with @fig-dag-reflectiveassumptions-compatible_again. Here too, cross-sectional data cannot decide between these two potential structural interpretations.

There are other, compatible structural interprestations as well. The formative and reflective conceptions of factor analysis are compatible with indicators having causal effects as shown in @fig_dag_multivariate_reality_again. They are also compatible with a multivariate reality giving rise to multiple indicators as shown in @fig-dag-multivariate-reality-bulbulia.

This results is worrying. The structural assumptions of factor analysis underpin nearly all psychological research. If the cross-sectional data used to derive factor structures cannot decide whether the structural interpretations of factor models are accurate, where does that leave us?

More worrying still, VanderWeele discusses several longitudinal tests for structural interpretations of univariate latent variables that do not pass.

Where does that leave us? In psychology we have heard about a replication crisis. We might describe the reliance on factor models as an aspect of a much larger, and more worrying "causal crisis"

## VanderWeele's model of reality

VanderWeele's article concludes as follows:

> A preliminary outline of a more adequate approach to the construction and use of psychosocial measures might thus be summarized by the following propositions, that I have argued for in this article: (1) Traditional univariate reflective and formative models do not adequately capture the relations between the underlying causally relevant phenomena and our indicators and measures. (2) The causally relevant constituents of reality related to our constructs are almost always multidimensional, giving rise both to our indicators from which we construct measures, and also to our language and concepts, from which we can more precisely define constructs. (3) In measure construction, we ought to always specify a definition of the underlying construct, from which items are derived, and by which analytic relations of the items to the definition are made clear. (4) The presumption of a structural univariate reflective model impairs measure construction, evaluation, and use. (5) If a structural interpretation of a univariate reflective factor model is being proposed this should be formally tested, not presumed; factor analysis is not sufficient for assessing the relevant evidence. (6) Even when the causally relevant constituents of reality are multidimensional, and a univariate measure is used, we can still interpret associations with outcomes using theory for multiple versions of treatment, though the interpretation is obscured when we do not have a clear sense of what the causally relevant constituents are. (7) When data permit, examining associations item-by-item, or with conceptually related item sets, may give insight into the various facets of the construct.

> A new integrated theory of measurement for psychosocial constructs is needed in light of these points -- one that better respects the relations between our constructs, items, indicators, measures, and the underlying causally relevant phenomena. (VanderWeele 2022)
