## NZAVS Report on Institutional Trust Pre/Post COVID

This report delves into the changes in institutional trust among New Zealanders from the pre-pandemic period in 2019 to 2022.

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study uses a two-item scale to measure **Trust in Science**

-   "I have a high degree of confidence in the scientific community."[@nisbet2015]

-   "Our society places too much emphasis on science."(reverse coded) 

We average these scores to form a single score [@hartman2017]. ^[We do not blindly adhere to the standard measurement approaches in psychometrics.  It might be preferable to work with single items instead of the averaged score. See [@vanderweele2022] for more information on this point.]
These items were introduced in NZAVS Wave 11 (2019 - 2020) ^[We must be cautious: causal identification requires contrasting outcomes under different exposures.  Because all were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, these contrasts are not identified without the strong assumption that there were no pre-existing trends in the acceptance of science before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.]

Previous research using a propensity score design reported on changes in Trust in Science during the first three weeks of New Zealand's COVID lockdown in March and April 2020 [@sibley2020].

**COVID-19 Government response** [@marques2022]

-   "I trust the Government to make sensible decisions about how to best manage COVID-19 in New Zealand."
-   "The New Zealand government response to COVID-19."

**Trust in politicians** [@sibley2020]

-   "Politicians in New Zealand can generally be trusted."

**Institutional trust in police** [@tyler2005]

-   "People's basic rights are well protected by the New Zealand Police."
-   "There are many things about the New Zealand Police and its policies that need to be changed."
-   "The New Zealand Police care about the well-being of everyone they deal with."

**General tendency to believe in conspiracies**[@lantian2016]

-   "I think that the official version of major world events given by authorities often hides the truth."
