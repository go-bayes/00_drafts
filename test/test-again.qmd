#| fig-cap: "Exposure confounder feedback is a problem for time-series models. Here, the problem arises from an unmeasured variable (U2) that affects both the exposure A at time 1 and the counfounder L at time 2. The red line shows the back door path that is opened when we condition on the L at time 2. Again, this problem cannot be addressed with regression-based methods. In this setting we may only use simulation based G-methods."

```{tikz}
#| label: fig-dag-9
#| fig-cap: "Exposure confounder feedback is a problem for time-series models. If we do not condition on L_t2, a backdoor path is open from A_t3 to Y_t4. However, if conditioning on L_t2 introduces collider bias, opening a path, coloured red,  between A_t2 and Y_t4. Here, we may not use conventional methods to estimate the effects of multiple exposures.  Instead, at best, we may only simulate controlled effects using G-methods. Multi-level models will eliminate bias. Currently, outside of epidemiology, G-methods are rarely used."
