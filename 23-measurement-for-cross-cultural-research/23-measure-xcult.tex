\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{State the population for whom the
causal question
applies}}{State the population for whom the causal question applies}}\label{state-the-population-for-whom-the-causal-question-applies}}

We need to define for whom our causal inference applies. For this
purpose, it is useful to distinguish the concepts of source and target
population, and between the concepts of generalisability and
transportability.

The \textbf{source population} is the population from whom our sample is
drawn. The \textbf{target population} is the larger group for which we
aim to apply our study's results. The closer the source matches the
target in ways that are relevant to our causal questions, the stronger
our causal inferences about the target population will be.

\textbf{Generalisability} refers to the ability to apply the causal
effects estimated from a sample to the source population. In simpler
terms, it deals with the extrapolation of causal knowledge from a sample
to the broader population. This concept is also called ``external
validity.''

\[\text{Generalisability} = PATE \approx ATE_{\text{sample}}\]

Where the \(PATE\) is a population average treatment effect. Although
beyond the scope of this study, we may use post-stratification weights
to obtain the PATE such that

\[PATE =  f(ATE_{\text{source}}, W)\]

where \(f(.,W)\) denotes a survey weighting function.

\textbf{Transportability} refers to the ability to extrapolate causal
effects learned from a source population to a target population when
certain conditions are met. It pertains to the transfer of causal
knowledge across different settings or populations.

\[\text{Transportability} = ATE_{\text{target}} \approx f(ATE_{\text{source}}, T)\]

where \(f\) is a function and \(T\) is a function that maps the results
from our source population to another population. To achieve
transportability, we need information about the source and target
populations and an understanding of how the relationships between
treatment, outcome, and covariates differ between the populations.
Assessing transportability requires additional data or specialist
knowledge. For example whether the causal effects for the effect of
religious service attendance in one culture at one time transport to
same culture at another time, or to another culture, cannot be
determined \emph{a priori}.

\hypertarget{types-of-measurement-error}{%
\subsection{Types of measurement
error}\label{types-of-measurement-error}}

\hypertarget{uncorrelated-non-differential-undirected-measurement-error}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{1. \textbf{Uncorrelated non-differential
(undirected) measurement
error}}{1. Uncorrelated non-differential (undirected) measurement error}}\label{uncorrelated-non-differential-undirected-measurement-error}}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-uu-null}, uncorrelated non-differential
measurement error occurs when the errors in measurement of the exposure
and outcome are not related to each other or to the level of exposure or
outcome. For example, imagine that some ancient societies randomly
omitted or added details about `beliefs in Big Gods' and `social
complexity' in their records, or that the records were not preserved
equally across cultures for reasons unrelated to these parameters. In
this case, errors in the documentation of both variables are random and
not related to the intensity of the beliefs in Big Gods or the level of
social complexity. Here we would have an instance of uncorrelated and
non-differential error.

Uncorrelated non-differential measurement error does not create bias
under the null. As evident from Figure~\ref{fig-dag-uu-null},
d-separation is preserved. However, if there were a true effect of the
exposure on the outcome, non-differential measurement error in both the
exposure and the outcome would lead to an attenuation of the true effect
estimate. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as ``regression
dilution bias'' or ``attenuation bias''. This scenario is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-uu-null}. The presence of uncorrelated undirected
measurement error in the exposure and outcome variables can lead to
attenuation bias because the effect size is underestimated due to the
`noise' introduced by these errors. Depending on one's loss function,
failing to detect true effects may be more harmful than bias away from
the null. For this reason, uncorrelated non-differential measurement
error can be problematic even though it does not induce bias away from
the null.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{2. \textbf{Uncorrelated differential (or
directed) measurement
error}}{2. Uncorrelated differential (or directed) measurement error}}\label{uncorrelated-differential-or-directed-measurement-error}}

As shown in @ fig-dag-indep-d-effect, uncorrelated differential (or
directed) measurement error occurs when the errors in measurement are
related to the level of exposure or outcome, but not to each other. For
instance, societies with stronger `beliefs in Big Gods' might provide
more detailed accounts of their religious beliefs, but the quality or
extent of their records on `social complexity' might not be affected by
their religious beliefs or vice versa. Here, the errors are differential
as they depend on the intensity of religious beliefs, but uncorrelated
as the errors in documenting `beliefs in Big Gods' and `social
complexity' are independent of each other. Uncorrelated differential (or
directed) measurement error is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-indep-d-effect} and leads to bias under the null.
The bias preented in \textbf{?@fig-directed-measurement-error} is an
example of directed measurement error from panel attrition in which the
true exposure and the true outcome affect selection.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{3. \textbf{Correlated non-differential
(undirected) measurement
error}}{3. Correlated non-differential (undirected) measurement error}}\label{correlated-non-differential-undirected-measurement-error}}

As shown Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect} correlated non-differential
(undirected) measurement error occurs when the errors in measuring both
exposure and outcome are related to each other, but not to the level of
exposure or outcome. The scenario is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-d-d}. Imagine that some societies had more advanced
record-keeping systems that resulted in more accurate and detailed
accounts of both `beliefs in Big Gods' and `social complexity'. These
errors might be correlated because the accuracy of records on both
variables is influenced by the same underlying factor (the
record-keeping abilities), but they are non-differential as they do not
depend on the intensity of religious beliefs or the level of social
complexity. Correlated non-differential measurement error may induce
bias under the null.

As presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-d-d}, correlated differential
(directed) measurement error occurs when the errors in measurement are
related to each other and also to the level of exposure or outcome.
Suppose that societies with stronger beliefs in Big Gods tend to have
more detailed records about their religious beliefs and social
structure, possibly because a highly organized religion encourages
elaborate documentation or monumental architecture. In this case, the
errors are differential because societies with stronger beliefs in Big
Gods have less error in their documentation, and correlated because the
same factor (strength of religious beliefs) influences the errors in
both `beliefs in Big Gods' and `social complexity'.

\subsection{Comparative research viewed as correlated undirected

Against invariance testing, we should approach comparative research from
the vantage point of correlated measurement error. Amending
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect}. Selecting on unmeasured correlated
error structures in the world we have
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-dep-u-effect-selection}. Were we to select from a
setting in which there was no systematic (correlated) error structures
between the measurements of the exposures and the measurements of the
outcomes we would avoid such confounding.

Note that it is not merely a matter of transporting results from the
sample population to another population. Rather, the act of selection
induces bias.

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth,height=\textheight]{23-measure-xcult_files/figure-pdf/fig_dag_multiple_version_treatment_dag-1.pdf}

}

\caption{Multiple Versions of treatment. Heae, A is regarded to bbe a
coarseneed version of K}

\end{figure}

Recall, a causal effect is defined as the difference in the expected
potential outcome when everyone is exposed (perhaps contrary to fact) to
one level of a treatment, conditional on their levels of a confounder,
with the expected potential outcome when everyone is exposed to a a
different level of a treatement (perhaps contrary to fact), conditional
on their levels of a counfounder.

\[ \delta = \sum_l \left( \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a,l] - \mathbb{E}[Y|A=a^*,l] \right) P(l)\]

where \(\delta\) is the causal estimand on the difference scale
\((\mathbb{E}[Y^0 - Y^0])\).

In causal inference, the multiple versions of treatment theory allows us
to handle situations where the treatment isn not uniform, but instead
has several variations. Each variation or ``version'' of the treatment
can have a different effect on the outcome. However, consistency is not
violated because it is redefined: for each version of the treatment, the
outcome under that version is equal to the observed outcome when that
version is received. Put differently we may think of the indicator \(A\)
as corresponding to many version of the true treament \(K\). Where
conditional independence holds such that there is a absence of
confounding for the effect of \(K\) on \(Y\) given \(L\), we have:
\(Y(k)\coprod A|K,L\). This states conditional on \(L\), \(A\) gives no
information about \(Y\) once \(K\) and \(L\) are accounted for. When
\(Y = Y(k)\) if \(K = k\) and Y\((k)\) is independent of \(K\),
condition on \(L\), then \(A\) may be thought of as a coarsened
indicator of \(K\), as shown in
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-fig_dag_multiple_version_treatment_dag}{\textbf{fig\_dag\_multiple\_version\_treatment\_dag?}}).
We may estimate consistent causal effects where:

\[ \delta = \sum_{k,l} \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a,l) P(l) - \sum_{k,l} \mathbb{E}[Y(k)|l] P(k|a^*,l) P(l)\]

The scenario represents a hypothetical randomised trial where within
strata of covariates \(L\), individuals in one group receive a treatment
\(K\) version randomly assigned from the distribution of \(K\)
distribution \((A = 1, L = l)\) sub-population. Meanwhile, individuals
in the other group receive a randomly assigned \(K\) version from
\((A = 0, L = l)\)

This theory finds its utility in practical scenarios where treatments
seldom resemble each other (see:
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2013}{Tyler J. VanderWeele and Hernan
2013})).

\hypertarget{reflective-and-formative-measurement-models-may-be-approached-as-multiple-versions-of-treatment}{%
\subsection{Reflective and formative measurement models may be
approached as multiple versions of
treatment}\label{reflective-and-formative-measurement-models-may-be-approached-as-multiple-versions-of-treatment}}

Vanderweele applies the following substitution:

\[\delta = \sum_{\eta,l} \mathbb{E}[Y_\eta|l] P(\eta|A=a+1,l) P(l) - \sum_{\eta,l} \mathbb{E}[Y_\eta|l] P(\eta|A=a,l) P(l)\]

Specifically, we substitue \(K\) with \(\eta\) from the previous
section, and compare the measurement response \(A = a + 1\) with
\(A = a\). We discover that if the influence of \(\eta\) on \(Y\) is not
confounded given \(L\), then the multiple versions of reality consistent
with the reflective and formative statistical models of reality will not
lead to biased estimation. \(\delta\) retains its interpretability as a
comparison in a hypothetical randomised trial in which the distribution
of coarsened measures of \(\eta_A\) are balanced within levels of the
treatment, conditional on \(\eta_L\).

This connection between measurement and the multiple versions of
treatment framework provides a hope for consistent causal inference
varying reliabilities of measurement.

However, as with the theory of multiple treatments, we might not known
how to interpret our results because we don't know the true
relationships between our measured indicators and underlying reality.

How can we do better?

\section{Measurement and psychometric

In psychometric research, formative and reflective models describe the
relationship between latent variables and their respective indicators.

\hypertarget{reflective-model-factor-analysis}{%
\subsection{Reflective Model (Factor
Analysis)}\label{reflective-model-factor-analysis}}

In a reflective measurement model, also known as an effect indicator
model, the latent variable is understood to cause the observed
variables. In this model, changes in the latent variable cause changes
in the observed variables. Each indicator (observed variable) is a
`reflection' of the latent variable. In other words, they are effects or
manifestations of the latent variable. These relations are presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-latent-1}.

The reflective model may be expressed:

\[X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i\]

Here, \(X_i\) is an observed variable (indicator), \(\lambda_i\) is the
factor loading for \(X_i\), \(\eta\) is the latent variable, and
\(\varepsilon_i\) is the error term associated with \(X_i\). It is
assumed that all the indicators are interchangeable and have a common
cause, which is the latent variable \(\eta\).

In the conventional approach of factor analysis, the assumption is that
a common latent variable is responsible for the correlation seen among
the indicators. Thus, any fluctuation in the latent variable should
immediately lead to similar changes in the indicators.These assumptions
are presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-latent-1}.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{the-formative-model-factor-analysis}{%
\subsection{The Formative Model (Factor
Analysis)}\label{the-formative-model-factor-analysis}}

In a formative measurement model, the observed variables are seen as
causing or determining the latent variable. Here again, there is a
single latent variable. However this latent variable is taken to be an
effect of the underlying indicators. These relations are presented in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-latent-formative_0}.

The formative model may be expressed:

\[\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon\]

In this equation, \(\eta\) is the latent variable, \(\lambda_i\) is the
weight for \(X_i\) (the observed variable), and \(\varepsilon\) is the
error term. The latent variable \(\eta\) is a composite of the observed
variables \(X_i\).

In the context of a formative model, correlation or interchangeability
between indicators is not required. Each indicator contributes
distinctively to the latent variable. As such, a modification in one
indicator doesn't automatically imply a corresponding change in the
other indicators.

\section{Structural Interpretation of the formative model and reflective
models (Factor
Analysis)}\label{structural-interpretation-of-the-formative-model-and-reflective-models-factor-analysis}}

VanderWeele has recently raised a host of problems arising for formative
and reflective models that become clear when we examine their causal
assuptions (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderweele2022}{Tyler J. VanderWeele
2022}).

\begin{quote}
However, this analysis of reflective and formative models assumed that
the latent η was causally efficacious. This may not be the case
(VanderWeele 2022)
\end{quote}

VanderWeele distinguishes between statistical and structural
interpretations of the equations preesented above.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Statistical Model:} a mathematical construct that shows how
  observable variables, also known as indicators, are related to latent
  or unseen variables. These are presented in the equations above
\item
  \textbf{Structural Model:} A structural model refers to the causal
  assumptions or hypotheses about the relationships among variables in a
  statistical model. The assumptions of the factor analytic tradition
  are presented in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-latent-formative_0} and
  Figure~\ref{fig-dag-latent-1} are structural models.
\end{enumerate}

We have seen that the \textbf{reflective model} statistically implies
that the observed variables (indicators) are reflections or
manifestations of the latent variable, expressed as
\(X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i\). However, the factor analytic
tradition makes the additional structural assumption that a univariate
latent variable is causally efficacious and influences the observed
variables, as in:
Figure~\ref{fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model}.

We have also seen that the \textbf{formative model} statistically
implies that the latent variable is formed or influenced by the observed
variables, expressed as \(\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon\).
However, the factor analytic tradition makes the additional assumption
that the observed variables give rise to a univariate latent variable,
as in Figure~\ref{fig-dag-reflective-assumptions_note}.

The reflective model implies \(X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i\),
which factor analysts take to imply

While the statistical model \(X_i = \lambda_i \eta + \varepsilon_i\)
aligns with Figure~\ref{fig-structural-assumptions-reflective-model}, it
also alings with Figure~\ref{fig-dag-formative-assumptions-compatible}.
Cross-sectional data, unfortunately, do not provide enough information
to discern between these different structural interpretations.

Similarly, the statistical model
\(\eta = \sum_i\lambda_i X_i + \varepsilon\) agrees with
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-reflective-assumptions_note} but it also agrees with
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-reflectiveassumptions-compatible_again}. Here too,
cross-sectional data cannot decide between these two potential
structural interpretations.

There are other, compatible structural interprestations as well. The
formative and reflective conceptions of factor analysis are compatible
with indicators having causal effects as shown in
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-fig_dag_multivariate_reality_again}{\textbf{fig\_dag\_multivariate\_reality\_again?}}).
They are also compatible with a multivariate reality giving rise to
multiple indicators as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-multivariate-reality-bulbulia}.

VanderWeele's key observation is this:

\textbf{While cross-sectional data can provide insights into the
relationships between variables, they cannot conclusively determine the
causal direction of these relationships.}

This results is worrying. The structural assumptions of factor analysis
underpin nearly all psychological research. If the cross-sectional data
used to derive factor structures cannot decide whether the structural
interpretations of factor models are accurate, where does that leave us?

More worrying still, VanderWeele discusses several longitudinal tests
for structural interpretations of univariate latent variables that do
not pass.

Where does that leave us? In psychology we have heard about a
replication crisis. We might describe the reliance on factor models as
an aspect of a much larger, and more worrying ``causal crisis''

reality}\label{vanderweeles-model-of-reality}}

VanderWeele's article concludes as follows:

\begin{quote}
A preliminary outline of a more adequate approach to the construction
and use of psychosocial measures might thus be summarized by the
following propositions, that I have argued for in this article: (1)
Traditional univariate reflective and formative models do not adequately
capture the relations between the underlying causally relevant phenomena
and our indicators and measures. (2) The causally relevant constituents
of reality related to our constructs are almost always multidimensional,
giving rise both to our indicators from which we construct measures, and
also to our language and concepts, from which we can more precisely
define constructs. (3) In measure construction, we ought to always
specify a definition of the underlying construct, from which items are
derived, and by which analytic relations of the items to the definition
are made clear. (4) The presumption of a structural univariate
reflective model impairs measure construction, evaluation, and use. (5)
If a structural interpretation of a univariate reflective factor model
is being proposed this should be formally tested, not presumed; factor
analysis is not sufficient for assessing the relevant evidence. (6) Even
when the causally relevant constituents of reality are multidimensional,
and a univariate measure is used, we can still interpret associations
with outcomes using theory for multiple versions of treatment, though
the interpretation is obscured when we do not have a clear sense of what
the causally relevant constituents are. (7) When data permit, examining
associations item-by-item, or with conceptually related item sets, may
give insight into the various facets of the construct.

A new integrated theory of measurement for psychosocial constructs is
needed in light of these points -- one that better respects the
relations between our constructs, items, indicators, measures, and the
underlying causally relevant phenomena. (VanderWeele 2022)

This seems to me sensible. However,
Figure~\ref{fig-dag-multivariate-reality-complete} this is not a causal
graph. The arrows to not clearly represent causal relations. It leaves
me unclear about what to practically do. My thoughts on measurement
presented in the main article offer my best attempt to think of
psychometric theory in light of causal inference.
