   Psychological responses to terrorist attacks afford insights into questions of longstanding interest to social and political scientists. Here, using a national-scale longitudinal dataset (N = 10,787, years: 2016 - 2020), we investigate how people changed across a spectrum minority group-attitudes. Becuase the data measure attitudes towards these groups in the years priors to the occurrence of attacks, our statitical models were able to disentangle causation. First, using a novel approach, we replicate the results of two previous studies that find the attacks increased the acceptance of Muslims. We then assess the predictions of Prototype Attitude Response Theory, which suggests the magnitude of response will be greater to prototypical minorities. We find evidence of prototyping. Results are robust to adjustment from time-trends in acceptance, and robust to selection bias from panel attrition. These findings are among the first natural demonstrations of prototyping in minority group attitudes.

## Introduction

\[KUMAR this is a placeholder I made up, you should set up the study as you think best\]

The processes by which people transfer of attitudes from one social group to another group is a topic of longstanding interest, but which is challenging to investigate empirically.

Prototype Attitude Response Theory argues that we might better understand these processes by clarifying why people classify groups as related to other groups. Accrording to this theory, prototypical groups are those that are perceived to embody the defining features of a larger social category to which they belong. By contrast, people may attrigute to non-prototypical groups a recognition of belonging to the category: however, people do not attribute to non-prototypical groups qualities that embodying the larger categories defining features.

For instance, in New Zealand, over 50% of all migrants identify as New Zealand European, suggesting that migrants are primarily of European descent. However, people tend to think of individuals from non-European ethnic backgrounds when asked to provide examples of migrants in the country, indicating that they are perceived as less prototypical within the New Zealand context ... \[**FICTIONAL STUDY**\]

Collectively, these literatures suggest that proto-typicality may play a crucial role in shaping our perceptions of minority groups, underscoring its importance in the study of intergroup relations. However, little is understood about the contextual and developmental factors that contribute to the formation of prototypical group perceptions \[**DESCRIBE THE GAP**\*\]

Here, using a national-scale panel dataset (New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, N = 10,878), we systematically investigate the causal effects of the March 15 2019 Christchurch Mosque attacks on attitudes towards minority groups in the country. uilding on Prototype Attitude Response Theory, we predicted that the magnitude of the response will be greater for members of groups that are perceived to be prototypical of the targeted group. Because study assessed attitudes towards these groups prior to the occurrence of the attacks and then again during the following year, under the assumption that the attacks affected social attitudes, our statistical models are able to identify, and quantify, causal effects.

## Methods

### Sample

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a national-scale probability panel study in New Zealand (APPENDIX), that started in 2009.

### Measures

The NZAVS panel survey measures attitudes toward groups using a "feeling thermometer" scale. Participants were asked "Please rate your feelings of WARMTH towards the following groups using the `feelings thermometer scale` for each group." Responses ranged on a 7-point scale from `Feel LEAST WARM Toward This Group = 1 to`Neutral" = 4 to Feel MOST WARM Toward this group = 7. In addition to ratings of Muslims, participants were asked to rate warmth to eleven other groups. Here, we use the terms "warmth" and "acceptance" interchangeably
