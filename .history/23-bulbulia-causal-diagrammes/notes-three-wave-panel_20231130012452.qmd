## Introduction

This article explores the benefits of collecting repeated measures data over at least three waves for causal inference. The advantages of this approach are made clear through the lens of chronologically ordered causal diagrams (CITE).

### Step 1. Ask a Causal Question

To answer a causal question we must first ask it [@hernÃ¡n2016]. This question must clearly specify the exposure (cause) and the outcome (effect), as well as their temporal relationship, within a defined context.

Suppose we are interested in the effect of religious service attendance on charitable giving, the causal question should be structured to clearly delineate these elements.

For example, the question could be framed as: "Does increasing attendance at religious services from infrequent (less than once a month) to frequent (weekly or more) lead to a rise in charitable giving over a one-year period?" This question distinctly identifies the nature of the exposure (increase in frequency of attending religious services) and the outcome (rise in charitable giving), along with a specific time frame (one year).

In a three-wave panel design, the timing of the measurements becomes integral to the study (see: [@vanderweele2020]). The question must ensure that the temporal order aligns with the objective of inferring causality. In our case, this could translate to: "How does a change in religious service attendance, measured from the beginning of the year (baseline) to mid-year (wave 1), influence the levels of charitable giving at the end of the year (wave 2)?" Here, the change in religious service attendance is captured between the first and second waves, while the outcome, charitable giving, is measured in the third wave, establishing a chronological sequence that tracks the sequence of cause and effect. Ensuring such temporal ordering is essential to every causal analysis.

Formulating the causal question with such precision is imperative, and must guide the entire study design, including which variables to measure and when. It ensures that the study is tailored to address the specific causal relationship of interest, laying a robust foundation for the subsequent steps in the causal inference process.

### Step 2. Ensure that the Exposure is Measured at Wave 0 (Baseline) and Wave 1 (An Interval Following Baseline)

Measuring the exposure at both baseline (wave 0) and a subsequent timepoint (wave 1) is crucial in causal inference studies. This approach provides several key benefits:

1. **Incidence Effect Interpretation**: By including baseline data, we can distinguish between incidence (new occurrences) and prevalence (existing states) effects. For instance, in a study on religious service attendance, this approach allows us to differentiate the effect of starting to attend services regularly from the effect of ongoing attendance.

2. **Confounding Control**: Measuring exposure at baseline helps control for time-invariant confounders. These are factors that do not change over time and might affect both the exposure and the outcome. In the context of religious service attendance, personal attributes like inherent religiosity could influence both attendance and related outcomes.

3. **Sample Adequacy Evaluation**: For rare exposures, baseline measurements can assess sample size adequacy. If a change in exposure is infrequent (e.g., infrequent to weekly religious service attendance), a larger sample may be needed to detect causal effects. By measuring exposure at baseline, researchers can better evaluate whether their sample is representative and large enough to detect such rare changes.

### Step 3. Ensure that the Outcome is Measured at Wave 0 (Baseline) and Wave 2 (An Interval Following Wave 1)

Measuring the outcome at both baseline (wave 0) and after the exposure (wave 2) is essential for several reasons:

1. **Temporal Ordering**: Measuring the outcome at baseline and then again after the exposure (wave 2) ensures the correct temporal sequence. This approach helps to establish that the exposure precedes the outcome, which is fundamental in establishing a causal relationship.

2. **Confounding Control**: Including the baseline measure of both the exposure and outcome allows for better control of confounding. This approach helps to isolate the effect of the exposure on the outcome from wave 1 to wave 2, independent of their baseline levels. It reduces the risk of confounding, where unmeasured factors might influence both the exposure and the outcome.

3. **Robustness Checks**: Baseline outcome measurements provide a basis for conducting robustness checks and sensitivity analyses. These checks are essential for detecting outliers, errors in data collection, and understanding the stability of the measured phenomena over time.

The dotted line indicates a reduction in bias arising from including baseline measures for the exposure and outcome. For an unmeasured confounder U to bias the exposure-outcome association, it would need to do so independently of these outcome and exposure baseline measures. The graph clarifies that by measuring confounders before the exposure and the exposure before the outcome, we reduce the potential for reverse causation, collider stratification, and mediator biases."

### Step 4. Identify Observable Common Causes of the Exposure and the Outcome

Next, we must identify and record at wave 0 (baseline) all potential confounders that could influence both the exposure (e.g., frequency of attending religious services) and the outcome (e.g., charitable giving). Proper identification and adjustment for these confounders are crucial for accurate causal inference. 

1. **Defining Confounders**: Confounders are variables that are associated with either the exposure or the outcome, or that might be a descendent of a common cause of both. We should exclude from this set any variable that is an instrumental variable.  For example, in the context of religious service attendance and charitable giving, socioeconomic status (SES) could be a confounder. Individuals with higher SES might be more likely to attend religious services regularly and also have greater financial capacity for charitable giving. We should ensure that good measures of SES are obtained at baseline.

2. **Measurement of Confounders**: Confounders should be measured at baseline (wave 0) to ensure that their relationship with both the exposure and outcome is properly understood and accounted for. This measurement helps in disentangling the true effect of the exposure on the outcome from the effects of these confounding variables.

3. **Grouping Confounders for Efficiency**: To maintain clarity in analysis, it is advisable to group confounders under standard labels when they have similar functional roles in the causal diagram. For instance, demographic factors like age, gender, and education level can be grouped together if they serve similar roles in influencing both religious service attendance and charitable giving.

4. **Use Causal Diagrams**: Causal diagrams allow us to visualise causal relationships among variables.

5. **Minimize Mediation Bias**: Recording confounders before the exposure occurs is critical for minimizing mediation bias. Mediation bias can arise when a variable is both a confounder and a mediator in the causal pathway. By identifying and adjusting for these variables at baseline, we can reduce the risk of incorrectly attributing the effect of the exposure to a mediator.


### Step 5. Gather data for proxy variables of unmeasured common causes at the baseline wave

If any unmeasured confounders influence both the exposure and outcome, but we lack direct measurements, we should make efforts to include proxies for them. Even if this strategy cannot eliminate all bias from unmeasured confounding, it will generally reduce bias.

### Step 6. State the target population for whom the causal question applies

We need to define for whom our causal inference applies. For this purpose, it is helpful to distinguish the concepts of source population and target population and between the concepts of generalisability and transportability.

1.  **The source population** is the population from whom our sample is drawn.

2.  **The target population** is the larger population for whom we aim to apply our study's results. The closer the source population matches the target population in structural features relevant to our causal questions, the stronger our causal inferences about the target population will be.

3.  **Generalisability**: when the causal effect estimated from a sample applies to the target population beyond the sample population, we say the causal effect estimates are generalisable. This concept is also known as "external validity."

Let $PATE$ denote the population average treatment effect for the target population. Let $ATE_{\text{source}}$ denote the average treatment effect in the source population. Let $W$ denote a set of variables upon which the source and target population structurally differ. We say that results *generalise* if there is a function such that:

$$PATE =  f(ATE_{\text{source}}, W)$$

4.  **Transportability**: when causal effects estimates may generalise to different settings and populations from which the source population was sampled, we say effects are transportable. Where $T$ denotes a set of variables upon which the source and the target population structurally differ, we say that results are transportable if there is a function such that

$$ATE_{\text{target}} \approx f(ATE_{\text{source}}, T)$$

This function similarly maps the average treatment effect from the source population to a target population. The function over $T$ might be more complex, as it must handle potential heterogeneity of effects and unobserved sources of bias. To assess transportability, we generally require information about the source and target populations and a specialist understanding.

### Step 7. Retain Sample

Maintaining a stable sample over the course of a three-wave panel study is critical for ensuring the validity of causal inferences. Panel attrition, where participants drop out of the study over time, can introduce significant biases. Therefore, strategies for sample retention are essential for data collection that is purpose built for causal inference.

1. **Developing Tracking Protocols**: Establish robust systems for tracking participants over the study period. This involves keeping updated records of contact information such as addresses, emails, phone numbers, and names, and accounting for changes over time. Advanced tracking methods might include periodic contact or follow-ups to keep the records current.

2. **Motivational Strategies for Retention**: Implement strategies to encourage ongoing participation. This can involve regular communication about the study's progress and impact, providing incentives for continued participation, or making the process as convenient as possible for participants. The key is to engage the participants in a way that motivates them to stay involved.

3. **Inclusivity in Participant Engagement**: Ensure that retention strategies are inclusive and cater to the diverse needs of the population under study. This might involve tailoring communication or incentives to different subgroups within the population or addressing specific barriers to continued participation that certain groups might face.

4. **Use Local Knowledge**: Engage with specialists who have in-depth knowledge of the population under study. They can provide insights into the most effective strategies for retaining different groups within the population.

5. **Participant Feedback and Adaptation**: Incorporate feedback from participants to improve retention strategies. This could involve regular surveys or feedback sessions to understand participants' experiences and adjust the study procedures accordingly.

6. **Addressing Potential Bias from Attrition**: Even with robust retention strategies, some degree of attrition is often inevitable. Plan for potential attrition from the outset by over-sampling and always include methods for adjusting for it at the analysis phase. 

7. **Continual Monitoring and Response**: Continuously monitor the rate and patterns of attrition throughout the study and implement responsive strategies as needed. This could involve targeted re-engagement efforts or adjustments in study procedures to address emerging challenges.

8. **Documentation and Reporting**: Carefully document all retention efforts and the patterns of attrition that occur in the study. This documentation is crucial for interpreting the study results and for informing future research.


Sample retention is mission-critical for preventing bias arising to panel attrition in three-wave panel designs. Researchers must be aware of it, and combat it.
